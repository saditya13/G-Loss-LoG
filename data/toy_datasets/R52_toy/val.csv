2426,european beet plantings seen little changed european sugar beet plantings are expected to show little change from last year despite recent firmness in world prices analysts and industry sources said a reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while so far european community ec growers plan unchanged to lower areas increases are expected in some eastern european nations trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant european beet plantings made last week by west german sugar statistician f o licht areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this in recent years good autumn weather has given yields a late boost making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons changes in ec areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so called c sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market this is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the ec a and b quotas which receive full and partial price support respectively some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the ec commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into ec intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high ec internal and low world market prices however with the ec budget stretched to breaking point this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic a and b quotas they added in france the largest producer of ec quota and non quota sugar the sugar market intervention board firs said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year s hectares nine pct below the previous year the basic trend is towards stability a firs spokesman said unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars white sugar french franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels he said beet sugar output last year was mln tonnes with an average yield of tonnes per ha the highest in the ec apart from the netherlands but below the previous year and a five year average in west germany recent price rises have not altered plans since planting decisions were taken a few

should yield about mln tonnes of whites last year s crop equalled the second highest ever at mln tonnes british sugar has a and b quotas totalling mln tonnes of whites and its c output is due to

around tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of c sugar last year the netherlands produced a record mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined a and b quota of only tonnes the world price of sugar
