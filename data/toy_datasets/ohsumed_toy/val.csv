27,"Buccal cellulitis.
 Buccal cellulitis (BC) is an innocuous appearing infection of the cheek that is found in children and has a high incidence of concomitant bacteremia.
 Typically, the child is younger than 12 months and has a 2 to 8 hour prodrome of coryza and fever before developing the cellulitis on the cheek.
 A purplish hue on the cellulitic region is highly suggestive of Hemophilus influenzae bacteremia.
 The differential diagnosis is reviewed.
 A complete blood count, blood culture, and cellulitis aspirate culture, should be obtained on all patients with BC.
 Meningitis may be present despite the lack of meningeal signs.
 A lumbar puncture should be performed on all children at risk for bacteremic BC.
 The vast majority of these children are bacteremic and require parenteral antibiotics.
 A typical case of BC is presented and its management is reviewed.

137,"An HIV-1 and HIV-2 cross-reactive cytotoxic T-cell epitope.
 The HLA-B27-restricted HIV gag cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope, 265-279, is highly conserved amongst HIV-1 isolates, only one, HIV-1ELI, having a single amino acid substitution.
 Over the same region HIV-2 differs by five amino acids.
 As a broadly cross-protective AIDS vaccine should protect against infection from all isolates of HIV-1 and HIV-2, we tested CTL specific for the HIV-1 265-279 epitope with peptide analogues from HIV-1ELI, HIV-2 and two simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates, and with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the respective gag genes, to determine whether there was any cross-reactivity for this CTL epitope.
 CTL from the HIV-1-infected donor could recognize the HIV-1ELI peptide, the HIV-2 peptide and recombinant vaccinia virus-infected target and one of the two SIV peptide-treated targets.
 Epitopes that exhibit such cross-reactivity may be valuable in vaccine design.

 A case of diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL) acquired in Peru is described.
 The causative agent was Leishmania mexicana amazonensis as determined by isoenzyme analysis and species-specific monoclonal antibody binding characteristics.
 Histological examination of biopsy material showed a large number of intracellular and extracellular amastigotes and few lymphocytes.
 Treatment with meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime) administered iv at a dosage of 20 mg antimony/kg body weight/day for 60 days resulted in visible improvement of the lesions, but not in clinical or parasitological cure.

250,"An immunohistochemical study of pi class glutathione S-transferase expression in normal human tissue.
 Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), a family of isoenzymes that play an important role in protecting cells from cytotoxic and carcinogenic agents, can be separated by biochemical and immunologic characteristics into three distinct classes named alpha, mu, and pi.
 Previous studies have indicated that there is marked heterogeneity in the expression of different GST isoenzymes in different normal and malignant tissues.
 To better understand the regulation of the human pi class glutathione S-transferase isoenzyme (GST-pi), the tissue distribution of this protein wa studied by an immunohistochemical technique using an anti-GST-pi polyclonal antibody in normal paraffin-embedded human tissues.
 These studies indicate that there is a broad distribution of GST-pi in normal human tissues and establish a precise localization within the different organs studied.
 GST-pi was expressed predominantly in normal epithelial cells of the urinary, digestive, and respiratory tracts, suggesting a possible role for GST-pi in detoxication and elimination of toxic substances.
 Previous studies have indicated that GST-pi and the putative drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein are both overexpressed in multidrug-resistant human breast cancer cells and in xenobiotic resistant preneoplastic rat hyperplastic liver nodules.
 Results from this study indicate that there are also similarities between the normal tissue distribution GST-pi and that previously reported for mammalian P-glycoprotein, particularly in secretory epithelia.
 This finding suggests that these two gene products, which have been implicated in the development of resistance to cytotoxic drugs, may be coregulated in normal and malignant cells.

451,"Elevated insulin receptor content in human breast cancer.
 The growth of breast cancer cells is under the regulation of hormones, growth factors, and their receptors.
 In the present study, we have employed a new, sensitive, and specific radioimmunoassay for the direct measurement of insulin receptors in surgical specimens of breast cancers.
 In 159 specimens the insulin receptor content was 6.15 +/- 3.69 ng/0.1 mg protein.
 This value was more than sixfold higher than the mean value found in both 27 normal breast tissues obtained at total mastectomy (0.95 + 0.68, P less than 0.001) and in six normal specimens obtained from reduction mammoplasty (0.84 +/- 0.78, P less than 0.001).
 The insulin receptor content in breast cancer tissues was also higher than in any normal tissue investigated including liver (Pezzino, V., V.

 The insulin receptor in breast cancer retained its ability to both bind insulin and undergo insulin-induced tyrosine kinase activation.
 Immunostaining of the specimens revealed that the insulin receptor was present in malignant epithelial cells, but was not detected in stromal and inflammatory cells.
 Univariant analysis revealed that the insulin receptor content of the tumors correlated positively with tumor size (P = 0.014), histological grading (P = 0.030), and the estrogen receptor content (P = 0.035).
 There were no significant correlations between insulin receptor content and the age, body weight, menopausal status, and nodal involvement of the patients.
 These studies indicate, therefore, that the insulin receptor content is increased in breast cancers and raise the possibility that the insulin receptor may have a role in the biology of these tumors.

631,"Quantitative evaluation of digital dental radiograph imaging systems.
 Two digital imaging systems, a video camera and analog-to-digital converter, and a charge-coupled device linear photodiode array slide scanner, were tested for their suitability in quantitative studies of periodontal disease.
 The information content in the original films was estimated, and digital systems were assessed according to these requirements.
 Radiometric and geometric performance criteria for the digital systems were estimated from measurements and observations.
 The scanner-based image acquisition (digitization) system had no detectable noise and had a modulation transfer function curve superior to that of the video-based system.
 The scanner-based system was equivalent to the video-based system in recording radiographic film densities and had more geometric distortion than the video-based system.
 The comparison demonstrated the superiority of the charge-coupled device linear array system for the quantification of periodontal disease extent and activity.

598,"Radiographic appearances in lumbar disc prolapse.
 The pre-operative lumbar spine radiographs of 200 consecutive patients who had undergone discectomy for prolapsed intervertebral disc were reviewed.
 Prolapse was recognized as bulging or sequestration of the disc with consequent root compromise.
 Measurement of the lumbar level of the interiliac line was shown to correlate with the level of disc prolapse and the incidence of transitional vertebrae at the lumbosacral junction was significantly higher than normal.
 A pathological value for the lumbosacral angle could not be identified.

662,"Histologic, biochemical, and ion analysis of tissue and fluids retrieved during total hip arthroplasty.
 Large amounts of metal and polyethylene debris and high ion readings are found in capsule and fibrous membranes of both loose titanium and cobalt-chromium stems.
 Prostaglandin E2, interleukin-1, and collagenase levels are elevated when compared to control values with collagenase having the highest and most consistent elevations.
 Synovial fluid and blood ion readings were elevated in loose cemented and cementless stems made from both materials.
 Blood ion readings were not elevated in fixed stems.
 Fixed stems had much less particulate debris in soft tissues.
 The data showed that failure of most metal hip stems was initially due to a mechanical cause, with high debris and ion counts occurring secondarily in capsule and fibrous membranes.
 Particulate debris and high ion readings are primarily a focal problem contained by the periprosthetic fibrous connective-tissue encapsulation within the femoral canal and joint capsules.
 No systemic problems were manifest in any of the patients examined and followed in this study.

604,"High lumbar disc degeneration. Incidence and etiology.
 Three hundred seventy-nine consecutive magnetic resonance images (MRIs) with dual-echo images of the entire lumbar spine were reviewed by the authors.
 All 379 patients presented with back pain and/or leg pain; they were interviewed and examined.
 Pain drawings were completed by all.
 There were 42 patients (11.1%) with disc pathologies involving T12-L1, L1-2, and/or L2-3 levels.
 Six patients (1.6%) had isolated disc degeneration and/or herniations limited only to these high lumbar segments.
 The remaining 36 patients had degenerative changes of the higher discs with variable involvement of the lower lumbar discs.
 Out of 12 spondylolistheses of L5 on S1, 7 had high disc pathologies at one or more levels presenting as skipped lesions; more severe high disc lesions were noted in Grade II slips.
 Isolated high disc degeneration is often associated with pre-existing abnormalities such as end-plate defects, Scheuermann's disease, limbus vertebra, and so forth, and stressful cumulative work activities such as in construction workers, airplane mechanics, and so forth.
 High disc degeneration was noted above or below previous fractures.
 High disc involvement with diffuse changes in lower lumbar spine was more commonly found in ascending fashion in older age groups, and in patients who have had previous lower lumbar spine surgeries, prior fusions in particular.
 Our findings suggest that altered mechanics are associated with the high lumbar disc pathologies.

837,"Hemodynamic changes in splenic blood flow during and after distal splenorenal shunt.
 The purpose of this study was to examine the hemodynamic changes of the spleen and the subsequent influence on the numbers of blood cells both during and 1 month after distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS) with splenopancreatic disconnection in 20 patients with portal hypertension.
 The intraoperative splenic blood flow, measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter, significantly increased after shunt insertion: the mean percentage increases within the splenic vein and artery were 60% (p less than 0.01) and 37% (p less than 0.05), respectively.
 The splenic venous blood flow, measured with a pulsed Doppler flowmeter, had not changed significantly 1 month postoperatively (676 +/- 501 to 540 +/- 306 ml/min).
 The WBC and platelet counts significantly (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively) increased 1 month postoperatively, whereas there was a small, but significant (p less than 0.05), decrease in RBC count.
 We concluded that splenic blood flow increases immediately after DSRS with splenopancreatic disconnection, but this increase may be only short term.
 The influence of the postoperative hemodynamic changes on blood cell count is uncertain.

859,"Whole organ sectioning of mixed parotid tumors.
 A pathologic study involving 15 standard formal parotidectomy specimens was carried out using the whole organ sectioning technique.
 Histopathologic characteristics noted included the presence of exposed capsule, breaks of the capsule, capsular incompleteness, tumor ingrowth and thickness, cellularity, and lymphocytic infiltration.
 Tracings of histopathology slides were used to reconstruct the three-dimensional configuration of each tumor as viewed from different angles.
 No tumor had a smooth surface.
 At the extreme, two tumor lumps were connected by just a narrow waist.
 Separated tumors were not seen.
 In only one specimen did a lymph node contain an additional tumor in the form of an adenolymphoma.
 All tumors showed some exposed capsule or ""bare area"" to a degree affected mainly by the position of the tumor.
 Capsular damage was occasionally seen and was usually minor.
 Capsular incompleteness and tumor ingrowth make global capsular dissection unsafe.
 It is concluded that formal parotidectomy remains the operation of choice for pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland, although capsular dissection (otherwise termed enucleation) cannot be entirely avoided during the procedure.

993,"Inspiratory flow dynamics during mechanical ventilation in patients with respiratory failure.
 We studied the effect of inspiratory flow rate on respiratory resistance during mechanical ventilation in 15 patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF).
 Resistance was measured by both constant flow inflation and occlusion methods as inspiratory flow rates were increased from 0.66 to 2.0 L/s.
 Endotracheal tube resistance was subtracted from total resistance to obtain respiratory resistance.
 In contrast to the flow-dependent increase in endotracheal tube resistance, respiratory resistance decreased continuously as flow rate and airway pressure increased, except in four of six patients with asthma in whom respiratory resistance increased as flow increased.
 Mechanical airway dilatation, tissue resistance, stress relaxation, and time-constant inequalities may contribute to the decrease in respiratory resistance.
 In status asthmaticus, however, the effects of turbulence, noncompliant airways, and/or ""reflex"" bronchoconstriction may be sufficient to cause a flow-dependent increase in resistance.

1024,"Distortion product otoacoustic emissions in normal and impaired adult ears.
 Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOEs) were recorded in a group of normally hearing subjects (29 ears) and a group of subjects whose conditions were diagnosed as sensorineural hearing loss (23 ears) to study any correlation that might exist between DPOE characteristics and hearing impairment of different configurations.
 Three different DPOE paradigms have been used to investigate the influence of different test parameters on the DPOE data for normal and hearing-impaired ears.
 All normally hearing ears demonstrated detectable DPOEs, provided that the primary tone level was above a certain value.
 Hearing-impaired ears produced substantially reduced DPOEs compared with normally hearing subjects when the primary frequencies f1 and f2 corresponded to the region of hearing loss.
 Our data also suggested that, in general, more than one f2/f1 ratio is needed to examine any particular frequency region.
 The DPOEs provide frequency-specific information about cochlear function, which after further development, may form a basis for a noninvasive, objective method of evaluating cochlear function.

1155,"Differential effect of oncotic pressure on cerebral and extracerebral water content during cardiopulmonary bypass in rabbits.
 To study the effect of oncotic pressure on brain water content during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), 14 anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits underwent 60 min of nonpulsatile CPB at normothermia.
 Animals were grouped according to the composition of the circuit priming fluid.
 Group 1 animals (n = 7) received a priming fluid (6.5% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.72 N NaCl; 323 +/- 13 mOsm/kg [mean +/- SD]) that maintained normal colloid oncotic pressure (COP) during CPB (19.0 +/- 1.5 mmHg).
 Group 2 animals (n = 7) received a priming fluid (0.9 N NaCl; 324 +/- 23 mOsm/kg) that led to a hypooncotic state (COP = 6.2 +/- 1.2 mmHg).
 Blood chemistries and hemodynamics were recorded every 15 min during CPB.
 Animals were given additional priming fluid and sodium bicarbonate during CPB to maintain a circuit flow of 85 ml.kg-1.min-1 and arterial pH greater than 7.35.
 There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 with respect to temperature, central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, PaO2, PaCO2, plasma sodium concentration, or osmolality at any time during CPB, although osmolality increased in both groups.
 After 60 min of bypass, animals were killed and organ water contents were determined by wet/dry weight ratios.
 A separate group of nine similarly prepared and anesthetized animals that did not undergo cannulation or CPB also underwent measurement of plasma chemistries and tissue water contents and served as nonbypass controls (group 3).
 Brain and kidney water contents were unaffected by oncotic pressure, whereas duodenum and skeletal muscle had significantly greater water content (P = 0.003 and P = 0.008, respectively) after hypooncotic CPB.

1267,"The use of conchal cartilage graft in involutional entropion.
 A simple and stable technique for repairing involutional entropion is described.
 Through a transconjunctival incision between the lower border of tarsus and the lower lid retractor, the eyelid is divided between the tarsus and the orbicularis oculi muscle into external and internal layers.
 The internal layer is moved upward until the eyelashes turn outward, and then through-and-through sutures are placed to fix it in this corrected state.
 The resultant defect between the lower end of the tarsus and the retractor is filled with a conchal cartilage graft.
 The raw surface of the cartilage is epithelialized from the surrounding mucosa within 1 to 2 weeks without shrinkage.
 This technique is more stable than any other technique that we have performed.

 A new single-stage surgical technique involved the disinsertion of superior oblique muscle to bring the eye in a midline position.
 Simultaneously it is used extraorbitally as a sling to raise the ptotic upper eyelid.
 Postoperatively a fairly good cosmetic effect was achieved, but the upper eyelid showed a paradoxic aberrant elevation on eso-depression.

1391,"Influence of high-energy shock waves and cisplatin on antitumor effect in murine bladder cancer.
 The potential application of high-energy shock waves (HESW) for control of experimental bladder cancer was investigated.
 Subcutaneous 3-d murine bladder cancer (MBT-2) in C3H mice were exposed to HESW alone (250 to 1,500 shocks) or in combination with cisplatin (5 to 10 mg/kg, i.p.).
 Although HESW alone showed no influence on tumor growth, HESW/cisplatin combination therapy suppressed tumor growth more than cisplatin alone.
 Subsequent studies revealed that an air-fluid interface relative to tumor location played a pivotal role for the chemosensitizing effect of HESW.
 HESW treatment was able to enhance the cisplatin cytotoxicity only when the tumors were placed adjacent to the air-fluid interface.

1519,"Comparison of endometrial biopsy and urinary pregnanediol glucuronide concentration in the diagnosis of luteal phase defect.
 To determine if pregnanediol glucuronide (PG) excretion is useful in luteal phase assessment, we compared daily first morning urinary PG concentrations during the luteal phase in nine normal and nine deficient cycles.
 Total luteal pregnanediol excretion (44.1 +/- 11.3 versus 64.0 +/- 11.6 area units +/- SEM) was not different.
 However, significantly less pregnanediol was excreted by the abnormal group during the 1st 5 days of the luteal phase (12.7 +/- 1.2 versus 18.0 +/- 1.7 area units +/- SEM, respectively).
 Thus, delayed PG excretion may be characteristic of luteal phase defect and measurement of urinary PG may be useful only if daily samples during the early luteal phase are obtained.

1489,"Effect of interleukin-1 on gamete interaction and mouse embryo development.
 Early stages of endometriosis have been shown to be associated with infertility.
 The pathophysiology of this relationship is unclear.
 To determine if interleukin-1 (IL-1), a peritoneal macrophage product, has any effect on gamete interaction and early embryo development, human recombinant IL-1 was added to the coincubation of gametes in the sperm penetration assay (SPA), human zona pellucida assay (ZPPA) and culture medium (Ham's F-10) used for processing semen samples with the layering method, with analysis of velocity and motility after 24 hours.
 IL-1 was also added to mouse embryos (two cells) cultured for 72 hours.
 The results showed that IL-1 caused impairment of SPA and ZPPA when compared to control medium, without significant alterations in sperm velocity and motility.
 Also, IL-1 demonstrated significant inhibition of mouse embryo development.
 These results help explain subfertility associated with early stages of endometriosis.

1472,"Alterations in phospholipase A2 activity during luteal regression in pseudopregnant and pregnant rats.
 The activity of phospholipase A2 was measured in microsomes prepared from ovaries of superovulated pseudopregnant rats during spontaneous and prostaglandin F2 alpha-induced regression and during regression in pregnant rats.
 Microsome samples were incubated at 40 C for 90 min in Tris buffer (pH 8.3) with 1.0 mM CaCl2 added.
 The substrate, radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine, was incorporated into liposomes.
 During spontaneous regression, there was a significant 2- to 4-fold increase in phospholipase A2 activity, when compared with levels at mid-pseudopregnancy (days 8-9).
 This elevation was correlated with a significant decrease in plasma progesterone concentration.
 On day 6 or 7 of pseudopregnancy, treatment of rats with luteolytic doses of prostaglandin F2 alpha also caused a significant increase in phospholipase A2 activity, which remained elevated throughout the 72-h sampling period.
 In pregnant rats there was a small but significant rise in phospholipase A2 activity after parturition.
 These results indicate that the activity of phospholipase A2 increases during luteal regression in pregnant and pseudopregnant rats and that it could be involved in the mechanism that causes the loss in progesterone secretion.

1496,"Maternal hemodynamics in normal and preeclamptic pregnancies: a longitudinal study 
 Preeclampsia is a disease unique to pregnancy that contributes substantially to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.
 The condition has been thought to be one of hypoperfusion in which increased vascular resistance characterizes the associated hypertension.
 This study was designed to test an alternative hypothesis, that preeclampsia is characterized by high cardiac output.
 In a blinded longitudinal study of nulliparas with uncomplicated pregnancies, cardiac output was measured serially by Doppler technique.
 Cardiac output was elevated throughout pregnancy in patients who became preeclamptic (P = .006).
 Six weeks postpartum, the hypertension of the preeclamptic subjects had resolved but cardiac output remained elevated (P = .001) and peripheral resistance remained lower than in the normotensive subjects (P = .001).
 This study demonstrates that preeclampsia is not a disease of systemic hypoperfusion and challenges most current models of the disease based on that assumption.

1944,"Prehospital cardiac arrest: the impact of witnessed collapse and bystander CPR in a metropolitan EMS system with short response times.
 OBJECTIVE: Numerous studies have shown initiation of bystander CPR to significantly improve survival from prehospital cardiac arrest.
 However, in emergency medical services (EMS) systems with very short response times, bystander CPR has not been shown to impact outcome.
 The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of bystander CPR on survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in such a system.
 DESIGN: Prehospital, hospital, and death certificate data from a medium-sized metropolitan area were retrospectively analyzed for adult, nontraumatic cardiac arrest during a 16-month period.
 RESULTS: A total of 298 patients met study criteria.
 One hundred ninety-five arrests (65.4%) were witnessed, and 103 (34.6%) were unwitnessed.
 Twenty-five witnessed victims (12.8%) were discharged alive, whereas no unwitnessed victims survived (P less than .001).
 Patients suffering a witnessed episode of ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia (VF/VT) were more likely to survive (21.9%) than were other patients (2.0%, P less than .0001).
 Among witnessed patients, initiation of bystander CPR was associated with a significant improvement in survival (20.0%) compared with the no-bystander CPR group (9.2%, P less than .05).
 Bystander CPR was also associated with improved outcome when witnessed patients with successful prehospital resuscitation were evaluated as a group; 18 had bystander CPR, of whom 13 (72.2%) survived compared with only 12 of 38 patients with no bystander CPR (31.6%, P less than .01).
 CONCLUSION: Our data revealed improved survival rates when bystander CPR was initiated on victims of witnessed cardiac arrest in an EMS system with short response times.

1935,"A note on the measurement of hypertension in HHANES 
 Using data from the HHANES, we found the rates of elevated blood pressure readings on clinical examination to be extremely low for a sample of Mexican American and Puerto Rican women.
 The prevalence rates were one-fourth to one-fifth the rates found for a comparable sample of White women from NHANESII.
 These findings are discrepant with the little that is known about hypertension prevalence among Hispanics and with estimates of hypertension prevalence for Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans drawn from NHANESII.
 While our HHANES samples women had much lower rates of clinical high blood pressure than Whites, they reported hypertension histories in excess of Whites.
 Rates of medicine usage among Hispanics were insufficiently large for effective treatment to explain the disparity.
 The prevalence estimates increased, but the relative discrepancies remained when we altered our sample specifications and clinical high blood pressure measure.
 A possible explanation for these discrepancies is that few physicians performed the majority of blood pressure readings in our HHANES sample.
 This may have been statistically inefficient.
 The discrepancies noted suggest that HHANES may not be a reliable source of information on hypertension among Hispanic women.

1870,"The effects of dopamine on myocardial functional recovery after reversible ischemic injury.
 Dopamine frequently is used to improve cardiac performance after acute myocardial ischemia.
 Inotropic agents, however, increase myocardial oxygen demand and could potentially delay recovery from ischemic injury.
 To evaluate this problem, we studied eight chronically instrumented dogs in the conscious state and performed two 15-minute coronary occlusions 48 hours apart.
 After one of the occlusions, either dopamine (15 micrograms/kg/min) or saline placebo was administered intravenously from 1.0 to 1.5 hours of reperfusion.
 The alternative infusion was given during the second study.
 Preload recruitable work area, the area beneath the stroke work versus end-diastolic length relationship, was used to assess intrinsic myocardial performance.
 Ischemia decreased preload recruitable work area to 13% of control after both occlusions.
 After reperfusion, a 30-minute dopamine infusion acutely increased myocardial function nearly threefold as compared with placebo.
 Myocardial performance after dopamine administration, however, was significantly depressed compared with placebo throughout the remaining 24 hours of reperfusion (p less than 0.01).
 These data indicate that dopamine may impair functional recovery after ischemic myocardial injury and suggest that inotropic interventions should be used in this setting only when absolutely indicated.

2144,"The hematopoietic defect in aplastic anemia assessed by long-term marrow culture.
 Thirty-two patients with aplastic anemia (AA) have been studied using the long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) system.
 Of these patients, 26 had been treated with immunosuppressive therapy including antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) with or without androgens or high-dose methyl prednisolone.
 The remaining six patients either required no treatment or were studied before therapy was begun.
 Thirty-one of 32 patients (96%) had defective hematopoiesis in LTBMC with little or no evidence for the generation of primitive progenitor cells.
 The only exception was a patient with spontaneous recovery of aplasia in whom the defect was less marked.
 Crossover LTBMC experiments were performed in 23 cases by inoculating (1) patient marrow hematopoietic cells that had been depleted of adherent cells onto preformed, irradiated, normal stromas to assess the proliferative capacity of the hematopoietic cells, and (2) normal marrow hematopoietic cells that were depleted of adherent cells onto preformed, irradiated stromas from patients with AA to assess stromal function.
 Results of these experiments demonstrated a hematopoietic defect in all patients that was independent of the degree of hematologic recovery after ALG therapy.
 Only one patient had a probable stromal defect and this coexisted with a defect in the regenerative capacity of hematopoietic cells.
 We conclude that LTBMC is a sensitive method for detecting and defining the hematopoietic failure in AA.
 We suggest that the defective hematopoiesis present in all patients studied may be important in the pathogenesis of clonal evolution in AA.

2218,"Gut blood flow velocities in the newborn: effects of patent ductus arteriosus and parenteral indomethacin 
 The effects on gut blood flow velocities of parenteral indomethacin (0.2 mg/kg) given either quickly as a bolus or slowly as an infusion were compared in consecutive studies of two groups of infants with symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus.
 In the presence of patent ductus arteriosus the range of velocities in the superior mesenteric artery before indomethacin was given was characterised by pronounced abnormalities including absent--or in some cases even retrograde--diastolic flow.
 In eight subjects the first rapidly given bolus dose of indomethacin (duration 20 seconds or less) caused a pronounced and sustained fall in the velocity of the superior mesenteric artery blood flow (mean peak systolic velocity (cm/second): before 74; after 38; median time to maximum fall 7.4 minutes; median time to recovery 50 minutes).
 A further 10 subjects received their first dose of indomethacin by slow infusion (duration 30-35 min) and the percentage fall in peak systolic velocity was both substantially less (22% compared with 47%) and later (median time to maximum fall 37.3 minutes) than after rapid infusion.
 Qualitatively similar but smaller changes were seen in the coeliac axis.
 Return of antegrade end diastolic flow in the superior mesenteric artery within one hour of the first dose of indomethacin was a good predictor of subsequent closure of the ductus.
 These data suggest that there is a profound disturbance in mid gut perfusion in infants with patent ductus, which is exacerbated by indomethacin given rapidly by intravenous bolus.
 They may also provide a rational explanation for the well recognised association between necrotising enterocolitis and both patent ductus arteriosus and indomethacin administration.

2229,"Respiratory muscle function in cystic fibrosis.
 Maximal static expiratory and inspiratory mouth pressures (PEmax and PImax) and quadriceps femoris muscle strength were measured in 25 patients aged 16-28 years with cystic fibrosis (mean FEV1 46% predicted).
 Mean (SD) PEmax was 64% (18%) predicted (below 75% predicted in 16 of the 25 patients), and PImax was 64% (24%) predicted (below 75% predicted in 14 patients).
 Quadriceps muscle strength was 68% (20%) predicted (below 75% predicted in 17 patients).
 The relatively small reduction in respiratory muscle strength in these patients was unlikely to have contributed appreciably to their respiratory problems.

2292,"Immunologic mechanisms in psoriasis.
 The demonstration of activated T lymphocytes, HLA-DR+, I-CAM1+, gamma IP-10+ keratinocytes, and increased levels of lymphokines in active plaques suggests that immunologic mechanisms may play a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
 Epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation in psoriasis may be linked by those cytokines many of which are produced by both keratinocytes and leukocytes.
 Epidermal acanthosis and keratinocyte mitoses have been observed in delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and after the intradermal injection of gamma interferon.
 Gamma interferon and its induced proteins have been demonstrated in active psoriatic plaques.
 Increased levels of the keratinocyte autocrine cytokines, transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6, have been detected in active plaques.
 The apparent overexpression of IL-6 in hyperplastic psoriatic tissue may explain features of psoriasis that link keratinocyte proliferation with immune activation and tissue inflammation.
 Both IL-6 and gamma interferon increased TGF-alpha expression in normal cultured keratinocytes.
 Cytokines produced during immune activation and other inflammatory processes may lead to epidermal hyperplasia.

2344,"Nutritional assessment and requirements.
 Nutrition plays an important role in health and disease, both in prevention and treatment.
 Increasing emphasis is being placed upon nutrition as a therapeutic tool to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cancer.
 Adequate nutrition should be a concern for all health care workers because of its impact on the overall health of patients.
 Health care professionals should be familiar with the essentials of nutritional assessment and basic nutritional requirements and be able to improve their patients' care in the face of nutritional deficiencies or excesses.

2518,"Interaction between insulin and glucose-delivery route in regulation of net hepatic glucose uptake in conscious dogs.
 In the presence of fixed basal levels of insulin, the route of intravenous glucose delivery (protal vs.
 peripheral) determines whether net hepatic glucose uptake (NHGU) occurs.
 Our aims were to determine if the route of intravenous glucose delivery also plays a role in regulating NHGU in the presence of hyperinsulinemia and to determine if length of fast (18 vs.
 36 h) influences regulation of NHGU.
 Five conscious dogs fasted 18 h were given somatostatin and replacement insulin (245 +/- 34 microU.kg-1.min-1) and glucagon (0.65 ng.kg-1.min-1) infusions intraportally.
 After a 40-min control period, the insulin infusion rate was increased fourfold, and glucose was infused for 3 h.
 Glucose was given either through a peripheral vein or the portal vein for 90 min to double the glucose load reaching the liver.
 The order of infusions was randomized.
 NHGU was measured with the arterial - venous difference technique.
 Insulin and glucagon levels were 12 +/- 2, 35 +/- 6, and 36 +/- 5 microU/ml and 55 +/- 12, 61 +/- 13, and 59 +/- 7 pg/ml during the control, peripheral, and portal infusions, respectively.
 The glucose infusion rate, the load of glucose reaching the liver, and the arterial-portal plasma glucose gradient were 0, 9.58 +/- 2.28, and 10.44 +/- 2.94 mg.kg-1.min-1; 29.4 +/- 3.6, 56.8 +/- 3.4, and 56.8 +/- 2.8 mg.kg-1.min-1; and 2 +/- 1, 5 +/- 1, and -51 +/- 15 mg/dl during the same periods.

2551,"Rebound increase in serum thyrotropin, anti-'microsomal' antibodies and thyroglobulin after discontinuation of L-thyroxine.
 We assayed serum thyrotropin (TSH), antimicrosomal antibodies (MSA), antithyroglobulin antibodies and thyroglobulin in seven individuals with subclinical autoimmune hypothyroidism during two 6-month periods with L-thyroxine substitution and placebo, respectively.
 Serum TSH decreased during L-thyroxine administration, with a rebound increase in serum TSH of about 6 months duration during placebo treatment, and a parallel increase in serum thyroglobulin.
 In agreement with previous observations by other groups, we found decreased serum concentrations of MSA during L-thyroxine treatment in three individuals.
 In addition, a slow but significant transient increase in serum MSA was recorded during placebo administration in the four individuals who showed the most pronounced increase in serum TSH (greater than 20 mU l-1).
 This association between serum levels of MSA and TSH is most probably related to antigen presentation at the surface of the thyrocyte.
 We conclude that changes in serum TSH concentration should be taken into account in the interpretation of MSA in patients with thyroid disease, whether untreated or treated with L-thyroxine.

2561,"Characteristics and correlates of asthma in a university clinic population.
 To contribute more comprehensive information about the characteristics of asthma, this article analyzed patients served by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Asthma Program.
 Their physicians rated one fifth of these patients as having ""severe"" asthma with the remainder about equally divided between ""moderate"" and ""mild"".
 One in two first received a diagnosis of asthma ten or more years previously.
 Common comorbidities were hypertension, obesity, rhinitis, bronchitis, sinusitis, and arthritis.
 One half had visited an emergency room or been hospitalized for asthma in the past year.
 Inhaled bronchodilators and continuous theophylline were the most commonly prescribed medications.
 Side effects, especially tachycardia and insomnia, were common and almost exclusively associated with theophylline or corticosteroid therapy.
 Spirometric assessment showed chronic airflow obstruction in those with more severe asthma.
 Prevalence of respiratory symptoms, intensity of medication regimen, incidence of side effects, and health care utilization increased as asthma severity increased.

2777,"Late versus early onset problem drinking in older men.
 Age at onset of problem drinking was studied in 132 older men (age 60 years and older) admitted to a VA geriatric alcoholism outpatient treatment program.
 Demographics, alcohol history, self reported psychological status, special treatment, and treatment compliance variables were tested for association with onset age.
 Late onset (defined as onset of the first alcohol problem at or after age 60) was not uncommon, occurring in 15% of the sample (29% of patients age 65 or older).
 Compared to earlier onset cases, late onset alcohol problems were milder and more circumscribed, and were associated with less family alcoholism and greater psychological stability.
 Late onset patients were also more compliant with outpatient treatment requirements; however, treatment program variables were better predictors of compliance than onset age.

2948,"The asymptomatic patient with suspected myocardial contusion.
 Diagnostic criteria and guidelines for hospital admission for suspected myocardial contusion (MCC) remain unclear.
 This study defines and examines the clinical sequelae of patients admitted with a suspicion of MCC.
 Criteria for observation following isolated, minor blunt chest trauma are suggested.
 Hospital and trauma registry records of patients admitted over a 33-month period with suspected MCC were reviewed.
 Conventional evaluation criteria, cardiac-related complications, and associated injuries were analyzed for 524 patients.
 Twenty-eight cardiac-related complications occurred in 27 of 524 patients (5%).
 These complications included 23 dysrhythmias, 3 infarctions, and 2 pericardial effusions.
 There were 23 patients with abnormal admission electrocardiograms and 4 with normal ones.
 Of the latter, one patient developed dysrhythmia 4 hours after admission, and three had other major multi-system injuries requiring admission to the intensive care unit.
 The overall incidence of cardiac-related complications in minimally injured patients was 0.1%.
 There were no complications in patients with isolated chest wall contusions, a normal admission electrocardiogram, and a normal rhythm at 4 hours.
 There was no significant association between creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes or echocardiogram and cardiac-related complications.
 The complete absence of significant cardiac sequelae in patients with isolated chest wall contusion, normal admission and 4-hour electrocardiograms, and no other associated major injuries suggests that these patients need not be admitted.

2977,"Comparison of phenytoin with noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists in a model of focal brain ischemia in rat.
 Recent in vitro and in vivo experiments have suggested that excitatory amino acid antagonists, particularly those active at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subtype, are effective in ameliorating ischemic injury due to their antiexcitotoxic activity.
 However, these drugs are also potent and effective in vivo anticonvulsants.
 The present experiments compared the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists phencyclidine and MK-801 with the anticonvulsant phenytoin in a model of focal brain ischemia.
 Fisher F-344 rats were subjected to tandem occlusion of the middle cerebral and ipsilateral common carotid arteries under halothane anesthesia.
 Compounds were administered intravenously 30 minutes and 24 hours after arterial occlusion; infarct size was assessed at 48 hours after occlusion.
 Phencyclidine had no effect on infarct volume at 1 mg/kg, significantly reduced (by 36%) infarct volume at 3 mg/kg, and produced a nonsignificant 26% decrease at 10 mg/kg.
 The more potent and selective noncompetitive antagonist MK-801 reduced (by 32%) infarct volume significantly at 0.1 mg/kg, produced a nonsignificant 23% decrease at 0.3 mg/kg, and had no effect at 0.5 mg/kg.
 Phenytoin, which is not a glutamate antagonist, reduced the infarct volume by 45% at 28 mg/kg.
 A single dose of phenytoin (28 mg/kg) administered 30 minutes after occlusion was neuroprotective, but delaying drug administration for more than 2 hours was ineffective.
 These data suggest that blockade of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor is effective in reducing the infarct size after focal cerebral ischemia.
 The neuroprotective activity of phenytoin suggests that this may be related to the common anticonvulsant action.

3150,"The anatomy and physiology of nerve injury.
 Nerves have a structure of considerable complexity with features of special relevance to nerve injury and nerve regeneration.
 These include variations in the cross-sectional areas devoted to fascicular and epineurial tissue, the fascicular redistribution and mixing of different branch fibers brought about by fascicular plexuses, and the numbers of nerve fibers representing individual branches.
 The elasticity and tensile strength of nerve trunks and their capacity to resist traction deformation reside in the fascicular tissue, while the epineurium provides a protective cushion against compression.
 The microstructure of nerve trunks provides the basis for a classification of nerve injuries into five degrees of severity with partial and mixed types--each with a clearly defined pathology and distinguishing clinical features.
 Following a transection injury, changes occur in the severed axons, endoneurial tubes, fasciculi, and nerve trunk.
 The type of injury and the nature of these changes determine the outcome of axon regeneration.

3075,"Iron chelation by deferoxamine inhibits lipid peroxidation during cardiopulmonary bypass in humans.
 Iron catalysis is involved in oxygen-derived free radical generation and subsequent lipid peroxidation, which have been reported to occur during cardiopulmonary bypass in humans.
 We assessed the effects of the iron chelator deferoxamine on the susceptibility of circulating low density lipoproteins (LDLs) to induced peroxidation in 20 adult patients (10 controls and 10 treated) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary or valve procedures.
 Deferoxamine was given both intravenously (30 mg/kg body wt, starting 30 minutes before bypass and extending for the next 4 hours) and as an additive to the cardioplegic solution (250 mg/l).
 Blood samples were taken from both atria before and immediately after the end of cardiopulmonary bypass.
 Plasma lipid peroxidation was assessed by measuring spectrophotometrically the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content of selectively isolated LDLs after their exposure to a peroxidizing agent.
 Before cardiopulmonary bypass, the right and left atrial blood values of LDL-TBARS were not significantly different between the two groups.
 Cardiopulmonary bypass resulted in a lipid peroxidation of significantly greater magnitude in control than in treated patients.
 Postbypass right atrial values for LDL-TBARS (expressed in mumol/mmol LDL-phospholipids) were 45.7 +/- 17.2 (mean +/- SEM) in control patients and 6.9 +/- 2.9 in treated patients (p less than 0.02), whereas in the left atrial blood, LDL-TBARS yielded values of 62.7 +/- 20.5 and 10.3 +/- 3.9, respectively (p less than 0.01).

3110,"Increased fatigue of isovelocity vs. isometric contractions of canine diaphragm.
 A comparison of fatigue as a loss of force with repeated contractions over time was performed in canine respiratory muscle by isometric (nonshortening) and isovelocity (shortening) contractions.
 In situ diaphragm muscle strips were attached to a linear ergometer and electrically stimulated (30 or 40 Hz) via the left phrenic nerve to produce either isometric (n = 12) or isovelocity (n = 12) contractions (1.5 s) from optimal muscle length (Lo = 8.8 cm).
 Similar velocities of shortening between isovelocity experiments [0.19 +/- 0.02 (SD) Lo/S] were produced by maximizing the mean power output (Wmax = 210 +/- 27 mW/cm2) that could be developed over 1.5 s when displacement was approximately 0.30 Lo.
 Initial peak isometric tension was 1.98 kg/cm2, whereas initial peak isovelocity tension was 1.84 kg/mc2 (P less than 0.01) or 93% of initial isometric tension.
 Fatigue trials of 5 min were conducted on muscles contracting at a constant duty cycle (0.43).
 At the end of the trials, peak isovelocity tension had fallen to 50% of initial isometric tension (P less than 0.01), whereas peak isometric tension had only fallen by 27%.
 These results indicate that muscle shortening during force production has a significant influence on diaphragm muscle fatigue.
 We conclude that the effects of shortening on fatigue must be considered in models of respiratory muscle function, because these muscles typically shorten during breathing.
