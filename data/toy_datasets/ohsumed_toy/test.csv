30,"Syphilis. A new visit from an old enemy.
 Syphilis has a number of stages, including a latent one, and may be overlooked or misdiagnosed if the possibility is not kept in mind.
 Adequate treatment during the primary stage results in a very high cure rate.
 The latent stage may last for years, during which time a woman may still give birth to an infected child.
 Symptomatic neurosyphilis occurs more often in men than women.
 Penicillin G is preferred to treat all stages of the disease; other antibiotics can be used for patients sensitive to penicillin.

67,"Hepatic extraction of indocyanine green is depressed early in sepsis despite increased hepatic blood flow and cardiac output.
 Although active hepatocellular function is depressed during sepsis, it is not known whether this occurs in the very early stages of sepsis and whether it is due to depressed cardiac output or hepatic blood flow.
 To study this, rats were subjected to sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture and hepatocellular function was determined at various intervals thereafter by assessing the ability of the liver to clear different doses of indocyanine green.
 The indocyanine green concentration was continuously measured in vivo with a fiberoptic catheter and an in vivo hemoreflectometer.
 Maximal velocity and kinetic constant of the clearance of indocyanine green, hepatic blood flow, and cardiac output were determined in experimental and sham-operated rats.
 The results demonstrate that hepatic blood flow and cardiac output increased 2 to 10 hours after cecal ligation and puncture, while hepatocellular function (maximum velocity and kinetic constant) was decreased even 2 hours following cecal ligation and puncture.
 No linear correlation between hepatocellular function and hepatic blood flow or cardiac output was found under such conditions.
 The extremely early depression in active hepatocellular function, despite the increased hepatic blood flow and cardiac output, may form the basis for cellular dysfunctions leading to multiple organ failure during sepsis.

62,"Urinary nitrate excretion in relation to murine macrophage activation. Influence of dietary L-arginine and oral NG-monomethyl-L-arginine.
 Murine macrophage oxidation of L-arginine guanidino nitrogen to nitrite/nitrate yields an intermediate effector, possibly nitric oxide, with antimicrobial activity.
 Total body nitrogen oxidation metabolism (NOM) was measured in vivo by determining the urinary nitrate excretion of mice ingesting a chemically defined nitrite/nitrate-free diet.
 As reported previously, mycobacterial infection with bacillus Calmette-Guerin led to a large increase in urinary nitrate excretion.
 This increase was temporally related to macrophage activation in vivo.
 The substrate for macrophage nitrogen oxidation metabolism in vitro, L-arginine, was deleted from the diet without ameliorating the urinary nitrate excretion response induced by BCG.
 This suggested that L-arginine was synthesized endogenously because there are no other known natural substrates for NOM.
 A competitive inhibitor of NOM, the L-arginine analog, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine was fed to mice in their drinking water.
 NG-monomethyl-L-arginine ingestion blocked both basal and bacillus Calmette-Guerin-induced urinary nitrate excretion over a 2-4 week time span.
 These experimental conditions should prove useful for further investigation on the role of macrophage NOM in host defense against intracellular microorganisms.

47,"Combined use of released proteins and lipopolysaccharide in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serologic screening of Yersinia infections.
 An ELISA for the screening of serum antibodies to Yersinia species was developed using plasmid-encoded released proteins of Yersinia enterocolitica O:8 and lipopolysaccharide of Y.
 enterocolitica O:3 as a combined antigen.
 Of 43 sera from patients infected with one of six different Yersinia serotypes, 40 (93%) were positive in this assay.
 When tested using six serotype-specific ELISAs with the corresponding Yersinia bacteria as antigens, 38 (88%) were positive.
 This screening ELISA detects antibodies to all virulent yersiniae in one assay and offers the possibility for diagnosis of infections caused by Yersinia serotypes seen only occasionally and not usually included in the serotype-specific ELISAs.
 Thus, this ELISA offers a substantial advantage by saving time and money in routine laboratory work.

42,"Malassezia furfur fungemia associated with central venous catheter lipid emulsion infusion.
 Malassezia furfur has been associated with fungemias in infants after prolonged intravenous lipid emulsion alimentation.
 Most cases of M.
 furfur fungemia reported in the literature involved neonates and required catheter removal for cure.
 M.
 furfur is probably an underreported problem in neonates as well as adults with central venous catheters, receiving lipid emulsions, because the organism requires selective enrichment media for growth, for example, Sabouraud's dextrose agar with sterile olive oil overlay.
 This case report of M.
 furfur fungemia in a neonates is unique because the neonate recovered on discontinuation of the lipid emulsion, without removal of the central venous catheter.

40,"Endothelin immunoreactivity in mice with gram-negative bacteraemia: relationship to tumour necrosis factor-alpha.
 1.
 To investigate the role of endothelin in Gram-negative bacteraemia and the possible involvement of tumour necrosis factor-alpha in its pathophysiology, we measured plasma and tissue (lung, kidney and spleen) immunoreactive endothelin levels in Gram-negative bacteraemic mice, with and without passive immunization by anti-(tumour necrosis factor-alpha) antibody.
 2.
 Plasma immunoreactive endothelin levels were greatly increased after the Escherichia coli injection.
 Pretreatment with anti-(tumour necrosis factor-alpha) antibody did not suppress elevated plasma immunoreactive endothelin levels (P greater than 0.1).
 3.
 Lung tissue immunoreactive endothelin levels in mice were increased 16 h after the E.
 coli injection and were not affected by prior passive immunization with anti-(tumour necrosis factor-alpha) antibody.
 Immunoreactive endothelin in spleen and kidney was undetectable (less than 34 fmol/g wet weight).
 4.
 Injection of rMu tumour necrosis factor-alpha into mice did not increase plasma immunoreactive endothelin levels.
 5.
 Antibody to endothelin given 30 min after a 90% lethal dose challenge with E.
 coli did not affect mortality.
 6.
 We conclude that the rise in plasma and tissue endothelin that occurs in Gram-negative bacteraemia is independent of tumour necrosis factor-alpha.

 Three new Chlamydia trachomatis serovars were identified by several monoclonal antibodies in the microimmunofluorescence test and are proposed to be called Da, Ia, and L2a.
 Each was clearly distinguishable from the related serovars D, I, and L2.
 To date, 7, 41, and 4 isolates of the respective serovars have been identified.
 Each appears to be distributed worldwide.
 The findings meet previously established criteria for establishment of new serovars.

10,"A study to assess the efficacy of chemoprophylaxis in the prevention of endoscopy-related bacteraemia in patients aged 60 and over.
 Five hundred and fifteen patients aged 60 and over (mean age 74.7; 278 men and 237 women) underwent routine endoscopic procedures (gastroscopy, bronchoscopy and cystoscopy).
 Alternate patients were given antibiotics before the procedure, as currently recommended, and blood was taken for culture from all patients within five minutes of completion of the procedure.
 Of 74 patients who underwent bronchoscopy, only one culture, from one of 37 controls was positive.
 Of 262 who underwent gastroscopy, cultures were negative in the 130 who received antibiotics but positive in 13 of the 132 controls (9.8 per cent p less than 0.001).
 Cystoscopy was performed in 179; one culture was positive in the 88 given antibiotics (1.1 per cent) compared to 25 in the 91 controls (27.5 per cent; p less than 0.001).
 Bacteraemia rates appear to be low following bronchoscopy (less than 5 per cent) but higher with gastroscopy (10 per cent) and cystoscopy (28 per cent).
 Chemoprophylaxis was effective in reducing these rates in this patient group.

0,"Infection in total joint replacement.
 Although a small number of infections in total joint replacements are blood borne from distant sources, most infections appear to have been derived at operation.
 Strenuous attempts to reduce this risk by cleaning the air in the wound environment, coupled with prophylactic antibiotics, have reduced infection rates by an order of magnitude in a decade.
 During that time the potential for exchange arthroplasty in established infection has been shown, and the results are encouraging.
 Rigorous infection control is the key to containing this difficult and expensive problem.

115,"Measles among the Amish: a comparative study of measles severity in primary and secondary cases in households.
 An outbreak of measles among a predominantly unvaccinated and susceptible Amish population in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, offered the opportunity to test the hypothesis that secondary cases in households are more severe than primary cases because the former have more intense exposure and receive a greater virus inoculum.
 Of 130 measles cases reported between April and June 1988, 119 (92%) constituted a study of disease severity.
 Severity was assessed by determining frequency and duration of symptoms, length of any hospitalization, and number of days in bed.
 In a univariate analysis, fewer secondary cases had conjunctivitis (relative risk [RR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.96) and headache (RR, 0.37; CI, 0.15-0.86), but more had earache (RR, 9.69; CI, 1.8-202.9) compared with primary cases.
 Secondary cases had a shorter mean duration of coryza (4.0 vs.
 5.0 days, Student's t test, P = .08).
 However, a logistic regression model that matched by family and controlled for age and sex indicated that there were no significant differences in measles severity among primary and secondary cases in households.

141,"Early and specific diagnosis of seropositivity to HIVs by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using env-derived synthetic peptides.
 We describe and evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a 22-amino-acid peptide corresponding to the carboxy-terminal end of HIV-1 gp120 and two 30-amino-acid long cyclic peptides including the two vicinal cysteines present on HIV-1 gp41 and on HIV-2 gp36.
 This test was evaluated.
 Data obtained with the Western blot (WB) and the peptide-based ELISA on a first panel composed of sera from 547 patients attending a specialized outpatient clinic (high-risk population) are in perfect agreement; moreover, 39 samples that had falsely been found positive with a viral lysate-based ELISA were not detected by peptide-based ELISA.
 The second panel was composed of 309 sera which were difficult to resolve using both WB and viral lysate-based ELISA.
 Using the peptide-based ELISA, 134 were found clearly positive and 173 clearly negative; only two were falsely positive.
 Finally, sera from 16 individuals examined at the time of seroconversion gave high absorbancy readings even if they were weakly reactive by WB (weak gp160 band).
 This test is thus highly sensitive and specific, and capable of detecting early seroconversion.
 It is also instrumental in clearly defining samples that are found indeterminate in the WB, and consequently it avoids the unnecessary follow-up required when a false-positive result is obtained using viral lysate-based ELISA.

132,"Multidisciplinary baseline assessment of homosexual men with and without human immunodeficiency virus infection. I. Overview of study design.
 Although much is known about the virus believed by most experts to be the cause of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and about its pathogenic actions, major areas of ignorance remain.
 Among these are the reasons for the varying time between infection with human immunodeficiency virus and development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the relationship between neurologic and medical aspects of the disease, the time course of neuropsychological findings, and the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity.
 We assessed 124 homosexual men who were positive for human immunodeficiency virus and 84 who were negative for the virus.
 In this article we describe the study design, method of recruitment, and medical and demographic characteristics of the cohort, which will be followed up for 5 years.

147,"Cytomegalovirus infection in sexually active adolescents.
 To determine whether cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in teenage girls is related to sexual activity, 254 girls 12-18 years old (mean, 15.8) attending a contraceptive counseling clinic were studied.
 Participants were screened for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis, and serum antibody to CMV was determined.
 Demographic and sexual history data were collected by interview.
 The mean number of lifetime sex partners was 2.2; 173 (68%) were seropositive.
 Race, greater than 3 years of sexual activity, and greater than 2 lifetime sex partners were significant risk factors for CMV infection (odds ratios [OR], 1.8-4.7; P less than .05).
 Using logistic regression analysis, a composite sexual activity variable was the most important risk factor for CMV infection (OR, 4.8; P = .003), followed by race (OR, 3.4; P = .004) and a sexually transmitted disease composite variable (OR, 2.4; P = .016).
 Sexual activity is an important risk factor for CMV infection in adolescent girls.

119,"Antibodies to HIV-1 nef(p27): prevalence, significance, and relationship to seroconversion.
 A sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunoassay for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) nef gene product, p27, has been developed using recombinant Escherichia coli-derived protein from the LAV-1-Bru sequence.
 Of 92 HIV-1 infected hemophiliacs, 72 (78%) produced anti-nef antibodies in this assay; the early appearance of anti-nef prior to full seroconversion was a rare event in this population, occurring in only one subject (approximately 1%).
 Anti-nef antibodies were not detected in any of 500 sera from 98 repeatedly HIV seronegative subjects who had been exposed to sexually transmitted modes of HIV infection (45 subjects) or through blood products (53 subjects).
 There was no significant association of titer or anti-nef antibody with protection from disease in HIV infection (p = 0.1).
 Although the nef protein is relatively immunogenic in natural infection, this study cannot confirm the previously reported high prevalence of anti-nef antibodies prior to seroconversion, nor the finding of anti-nef antibodies in HIV seronegative but exposed subjects.

179,"A spleen is not necessary to resolve infections with Plasmodium yoelii.
 The role of the spleen in resistance to infections with nonlethal Plasmodium yoelii 17x is dependent upon the genotype of the host.
 Thus, DBA/2 (D2) mice infected with P.
 yoelii 17x were not adversely affected by removal of the spleen, while splenectomized C57BL/6 (B6) or Balb/c mice failed to resolve their infections and eventually died.
 The levels of parasitemia were lower in splenectomized mice compared to intact controls; however, splenectomized mice became as anemic as did spleen-intact controls.
 Splenectomy resulted in the appearance of large aggregates of mononuclear cells in the livers of infected mice and also altered the liver/body weight ratios.
 These results indicate that D2 mice have a spleen-independent mechanism of clearing parasites which is lacking in B6 and Balb/c mice.

168,"A comparison of 6-, 12-, and 24-monthly dosing with ivermectin for treatment of onchocerciasis.
 This study was designed to examine the optimal dose and interval of administration of ivermectin, the now-accepted drug of choice for onchocerciasis.
 Two hundred Liberians with Onchocerca volvulus infection received 100, 150, or 200 micrograms/kg ivermectin or placebo and were followed for 36 months.
 The reaction after the second dose of ivermectin was significantly less than after the initial dose, although it was still significant in the 200-micrograms/kg group.
 The skin microfilaria counts in the group treated 6-monthly with 150 micrograms/kg was significantly less than in the group treated yearly (12 and 24 months after initial therapy).
 Prevalence of microfilariae in the anterior chamber and punctate corneal opacities decreased progressively in all groups over 3 years.
 There appears to be a slight advantage, in terms of antiparasitic effect over the first 2 years, of therapy given 6-monthly compared with yearly.

291,"The clinical pharmacology of etoposide.
 Etoposide, a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin, is increasingly used to treat cancer.
 Etoposide is a phase-specific, cytotoxic drug acting in the late S and early G2 phases of the cell cycle.
 It appears to cause breaks in DNA by either an interaction with DNA-topoisomerase II or the formation of free radicals.
 Most studies show a biexponential decay after the intravenous (IV) administration of etoposide.
 The peak plasma concentrations of drug and the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) are linearly related to the IV dose.
 Considerable interpatient variability of pharmacokinetic variables exists after IV etoposide.
 Various metabolites of etoposide have been identified, but their detection and quantitation are disputed.
 Approximately 30% to 70% of an etoposide dose is excreted.
 The bioavailability of oral etoposide is approximately 50%, but its absorption is not linear with increasing doses within the range in clinical use.
 Considerable interpatient and intrapatient variability exists in the pharmacokinetics of oral etoposide.
 There is no evidence of etoposide accumulation after multiple consecutive doses by either the IV or oral route.
 The exact roles of the liver and kidney in metabolism and excretion of etoposide are uncertain.
 Etoposide has been shown to be a highly schedule-dependent drug in clinical studies.
 This, together with the phase-specific action of etoposide and its increasingly widespread use in treating cancer, makes the clinical pharmacology of this drug of great clinical importance.

 Traditional measures of head and neck tumors often fail to predict patient outcome or clinical course, particularly in nonadvanced disease.
 This problem of unpredictable tumor behavior has been one focus of cell proliferation studies.
 Such studies, however, have been limited by difficult methodology.
 A newer method of quantifying tumor cell proliferation using bromodeoxyuridine is applicable for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, as shown in the present study.
 The relative ease with which cell proliferation can be evaluated using this technique will allow large numbers of head and neck tumors to be studied, enabling correlations with tumor behavior to be made.

 Thirteen years after excision and postoperative irradiation, a subcutaneous metastasis developed in the right arm.
 One year later the patient died with disseminated bone metastases.

258,"Intratumoral oxygen pressure in malignant brain tumor.
 Oxygen pressure (pO2) in brain tumors, pO2 in brain cortex surrounding the tumors, and PaO2 were measured simultaneously during total resection in 16 patients with previously untreated brain tumors in order to detect hypoxic regions within the tumors.
 When the inhaled O2:N2O ratio was 1:3 under enflurane anesthesia, mean PaO2 was 109.2 +/- 5.8 mm Hg, a rather high value when compared with that obtained when air is inhaled under atmospheric pressure.
 The simultaneously measured intratumoral pO2 and pO2 in brain cortex surrounding the tumor were 15.3 +/- 2.3 and 59.8 +/- 6.5 mm Hg, respectively.
 Each intratumoral pO2 value was significantly lower than that of pO2 in brain cortex surrounding the tumor (mean less than 30 mm Hg, Wilcoxon signed rank test, p less than 0.005) and influenced the oxygen effects on radiation.
 These results appear to confirm that there are hypoxic regions within human brain tumors.
 A comparison between intratumoral pO2 and either the angiographic or contrast-enhanced computerized tomography scans of the tumor vasculature disclosed no correlation.

362,"Bone sarcomas as second malignant neoplasms following childhood cancer.
 This study explores the relationship between histologic variants of bone sarcomas and previous therapy in patients in whom an unrelated malignant neoplasm had been diagnosed during childhood.
 Sarcomas of bone were the most common second malignant neoplasm (SMN) reported to the Late Effects Study Group, a 13-institution consortium consisting of pediatric oncology centers from western Europe, Canada, and the United States.
 The authors attempted to relate the histologic subtypes of the 91 bone tumors to clinical factors such as previous therapy and genetic predisposition because morphologic variants have been shown to have biologic significance in other tumors and may have etiologic import.
 The literature concerning the subtypes of bone tumors, clinical and experimental, is also reviewed.
 The authors also investigated the effect of several factors on the time interval from the first diagnosis to the SMN (i.e., the bone sarcoma).
 Anthracyclines significantly shortened the interval by about 3 years.
 The primary diagnosis also significantly affected the interval, with leukemia/lymphomas having the shortest interval and retinoblastoma the longest.
 The authors could not demonstrate any significant relationship between morphologic characteristics of the osteosarcoma and predisposing conditions.
 However, lesions diagnosed as chondrosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma occurred almost exclusively in patients who had received radiation therapy to the site in which the SMN developed.

465,"Tumor-secreted vascular permeability factor increases cytosolic Ca2+ and von Willebrand factor release in human endothelial cells.
 Vascular permeability factor (VPF), a tumor-secreted heparin-binding protein (Mr approximately 38,000), is responsible for increased vessel permeability and fluid accumulation associated with tumor growth.
 Vascular permeability factor also promotes the growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EC) and bovine pulmonary ECs in vitro.
 It is shown for the first time that guinea pig VPF (half-maximal and maximal dose approximately 0.4 and 22 pmol/l (picomolar), respectively), as well as human VPF, are potent stimuli for human ECs resulting in [Ca2+]i increases (maximal three- to fourfold) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) formation.
 Unlike the maximal responses to thrombin and histamine, the [Ca2+]i response to a maximal VPF dose was preceded by a characteristic 10- to 15-second delay.
 Guinea pig VPF also selectively increased [Ca2+]i in cultured aortic and pulmonary artery ECs, but not aortic smooth muscle cells, human fibroblasts, or neutrophils.
 Affinity-purified rabbit antibody (raised to a synthetic peptide representing VPF N-terminal amino acids 1 to 24) adsorbed all vessel permeability-increasing activity, EC growth-promoting activity, and specifically all activity responsible for increasing EC [Ca2+]i.
 Similar to other mediators that increase [Ca2+]i in cultured ECs, VPF also induced a 200% increase in von Willebrand factor release.
 Together these data indicate that VPF acts directly on ECs and that rapid cellular events in its in vivo/in vitro actions are likely to involve phospholipase C activation, [Ca2+]i increase, and von Willebrand factor release.

 Cross-linking an anti-tumor antibody, specific for tumor cell surface antigens, and an anti-lymphocyte antibody, specific for the T lymphocyte receptor complex (TCR/CD3), produces a heteroconjugate that can direct T cells to lyse tumor cells.
 We tested the ability of anti-tumor X anti-lymphocyte (CD3) heteroconjugates to redirect human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) to lyse human colon cancer cells in cytotoxicity assays and in a murine colon tumor model.
 We demonstrated in vitro, that cultured human PBLs alone produced low levels of tumor lysis, but PBLs treated with anti-tumor X anti-CD3 heteroconjugates produced significantly greater tumor cell lysis (P less than 0.0025).
 Similarly, nude mice injected with LS174T human colon cancer cells and treated with cultured human PBLs and anti-tumor X anti-CD3 heteroconjugates survived significantly longer than saline control mice (P less than 0.01), or mice treated with PBLs alone (P less than 0.01), or heteroconjugates alone (P less than 0.05).
 F(ab')2 heteroconjugates were equally as effective in prolonging animal survival, but irrelevant heteroconjugates and monoclonal anti-tumor antibodies showed no therapeutic benefit.

 This is the first report on the photodynamic treatment with a second-generation sensitizer, chloro-aluminum sulfonated phthalocyanine (CASPc) of spontaneously arising tumors and on the photodynamic therapy (PDT) of snake neoplasms.
 Each of 10 cats, 2 dogs, and 3 snakes presenting with a variety of tumor types (squamous cell carcinoma, mast cell malignant tumor, and mixed carcinoma/sarcoma) was given an intravenous injection of 1 mg of CASPc per kilogram body weight 48 hours prior to irradiation with 675-nm light.
 Some larger tumors (greater than 1.5 cm deep) were surgically debulked prior to PDT.
 No significant systemic toxicity or skin photosensitization was observed in any animal.
 The tumor responses were comparable to those seen with conventional cryotherapy, hyperthermia, or surgery.
 PDT with CASPc of these cases led to 67% (12 of 18) complete response, 22% (4 of 18) partial response, and 11% (2 of 18) no response (less than 50% reduction in tumor size).
 Four cases could not be evaluated.
 Since the overall tumor response to CASPc is very good, and the problem of skin photosensitivity is nonexistent, it is expected that using CASPc-PDT to eradicate human tumors would also yield comparable results.
 Further studies with long-term follow-up are necessary to optimize the use of CASPc-PDT in veterinary and human medicine.

 A randomized trial was performed to determine if therapy with tamoxifen (TAM) plus fluoxymesterone (FLU) was more efficacious than TAM alone for postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer.
 Patients failing TAM could subsequently receive FLU.
 The dose of both drugs was 10 mg orally twice daily.
 Objective responses were seen in 50 of 119 (42%) TAM patients and 64 of 119 (54%) TAM plus FLU patients (two-sided P = 0.07).
 Time to disease progression was better for TAM plus FLU (medians: 11.6 versus 6.5 months; Cox model, P = 0.03).
 Duration of response and survival were similar in the two treatment arms.
 Among 97 patients with estrogen receptor (ER) of 10 or greater and 65 years of age or older, there were highly significant advantages for treatment with TAM plus FLU in both response rate and time to progression.
 Of particular note is that in this patient group TAM plus FLU showed a survival advantage (Cox model, P = 0.05).
 Although these data require confirmation in a prospective randomized trial, they suggest that there is a substantive therapeutic advantage for TAM plus FLU over TAM alone in elderly women with ER of 10 fmol or greater.

 Endorectal ultrasonography is a valuable imaging method for examination of the rectum and perirectal tissues.
 We assessed 50 patients with known rectal carcinoma prospectively by using a 7.0-MHz endorectal transducer to determine the depth of invasion of the rectal wall by tumor and the presence of lymphadenopathy.
 Tumors were staged by using the Astler-Coller modification of the Dukes staging system, and the results were compared with histologic staging of the surgical specimen.
 Ultrasonography had an accuracy of 80%, a sensitivity of 92%, and a specificity of 76% for detection of invasion of the perirectal fat.
 Ultrasonography was sensitive in the detection of perirectal lymphadenopathy but was not specific in distinguishing benign from malignant nodes.

 One hundred twenty-two children with nonmetastatic osteogenic or Ewing's sarcoma were studied to assess the effect of multiagent adjuvant chemotherapy on skeletal growth and final stature.
 No deviations from the height distributions of a normal population were noted at diagnosis.
 There was a marked retardation of linear growth during the year of intensive chemotherapy.
 Only 15% of the patients grew at the expected rate during that year.
 The distribution of nutritional status scores was significantly different at the end of the first year than at baseline.
 The distribution of ultimate height scores was significantly different than the baseline distribution.

290,"Future directions for etoposide therapy.
 Etoposide is an important chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of selected patients with germ cell tumors, lymphomas, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
 Its optimal use is continuing to evolve.
 It is clear that schedule dependency is of critical importance.
 Recently, preliminary studies have suggested that a prolonged schedule of etoposide administration (21 days) may be more effective than the standard 3- to 5-day schedule.
 Results of several Phase II studies show chronic oral etoposide administration induces occasional responses in resistant tumors and higher-than-expected response rates in patients with germ cell tumors and SCLC.
 Preliminary data show nearly 90% etoposide absorption when given in a low-dose schedule (50 mg/m2/d) for 21 days.
 These observations indicate that etoposide may be a ""new drug"" when given in the chronic schedule.
 Further exploration of the schedule dependency of etoposide is indicated.
 Etoposide has recently been proven useful in selected patients with gastric, ovarian, and poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown primary site.
 Several other drugs are either synergistic or additive and will be explored in combination chemotherapy.
 The possibility of adding topoisomerase I inhibitors and modulating etoposide's activity by inhibiting drug resistance is now within the realm of human testing.

769,"Effects of site-directed mutagenesis at residues cysteine-31 and cysteine-184 on lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity.
 Native lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT; phosphatidylcholine-sterol acyltransferase; phosphatidylcholine:sterol O-acyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.43) protein, and LCAT in which either or both of the enzyme free cysteines had been replaced with glycine residues by site-directed mutagenesis, has been expressed in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the human LCAT gene.
 The mass of LCAT secreted, determined by immunoassay, did not differ in the native and mutant species.
 LCAT specific activity was also unchanged in the mutant species.
 In particular, the cysteine-free double mutant, in which Cys-31 and Cys-184 had both been replaced, was fully active in the synthesis of cholesteryl esters.
 This result is not consistent with a catalytic role for LCAT free cysteine residues.
 The classical inhibitor of LCAT activity, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), which strongly (89%) inhibited the native enzyme, had partial (45%) inhibitory activity with mutant enzyme species containing a single -SH residue, while the double mutant was not significantly inhibited by DTNB.
 These data are interpreted to suggest that Cys-31 and Cys-184 are vicinal both to each other and to the ""interfacial binding site"" at residues 177-182, and that DTNB exerts its effect by steric inhibition.

 Based on in vitro studies that have demonstrated synergy between 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin (LV), and cisplatin (CDDP) against human colon cancer cell lines, a clinical trial was initiated to determine the effects of this combination in patients with advanced unresectable colorectal carcinoma.
 Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in the study and 12 of them had received prior conventional 5-FU chemotherapy.
 Treatment consisted of 4 weekly courses of high-dose LV (200 mg/m2) administered by intravenous (IV) bolus, followed by 5-FU (550 mg/m2) and CDDP (20 mg/m2) each administered as a 2-hour infusion on 4 consecutive days.
 After a median of 5.5 treatment cycles, objective tumor response was seen in 20 of 59 patients (34%) (this included 3 complete remissions).
 The response rate in the 47 previously untreated patients was 38% (95% confidence limits, 26% to 53%).
 Stable disease occurred in 16 (27%) patients, whereas the tumor progressed in 23 (39%) patients.
 The median survival time was 11.5 months, with 15% of the patients alive at 2 years.
 The regimen was well tolerated and the primary side effects were mild and reversible gastrointestinal symptoms and myelosuppression.
 There was no episode of life-threatening toxicity.
 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Grade III adverse reactions that required 25% dose reductions occurred in only 14% of the patients.
 The results of this trial suggest that 5-FU, LV, and CDDP is an active, safe, and well-tolerated combination regimen in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

415,"Granular cell neoplasm of the extrahepatic biliary tree: morphological, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemical study and review of the literature.
 A recent case of a biliary granular cell tumor of the cystic duct prompted a literature review and an extensive pathological examination of the tumor in question.
 A total of 44 cases have been described mostly in black females.
 Most cases present with biliary symptoms, and simple surgical resection allows complete control of this benign condition.
 Granular cell tumors are most likely derived from neural crest cells.

211,"Renal vein leiomyosarcoma.
 The 11th case of primary leiomyosarcoma of the renal vein is reported.
 Unique features of this case included concomitant resection of an isolated hepatic metastasis, intraoperative radiation therapy, and the use of electron microscopy and immunohistochemical stains in confirming the diagnosis.
 A review of the previously reported cases shows a tendency toward slow tumor growth and infrequent recurrence (18%).
 Metastases are common (82%), primarily to the lung and liver.
 Aggressive surgical resection and adjuvant radiation therapy, including intraoperative radiation therapy, are recommended.
 Adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered, although its benefits at present are unclear.

393,"Watch and wait after careful surgical treatment and staging in well-differentiated early ovarian cancer.
 Patients with well-differentiated epithelial ovarian cancer Stages Ia, Ib, Ic, and IIa (FIGO 1976) were observed after surgical treatment without adjuvant therapy.
 Careful surgical staging was required, and the extent of the staging procedure was assessed in each individual patient.
 There were 107 patients entered in the study by nine Dutch oncology centers.
 Of these 107, 21 did not fulfill all of the inlet criteria of the study and were excluded.
 Central pathologic review was performed in the remaining 86 cases, revealing that there was borderline tumor in seven patients, moderately or poorly differentiated tumor in nine patients, and tumor of nonepithelial histologic cell type in one patient.
 In two cases, no material for histologic review was available.
 After exclusion of these 19 cases, 67 patients were further analyzed.
 None of these 67 patients was lost during the follow-up period that ranged from 19 to 99 months (mean, 50 months).
 Tumor recurrence was found in four patients after 11, 25, 34, and 34 months of follow-up, all of whom died shortly after diagnosis of the recurrence without satisfactory response to secondary treatment.
 For the patients who underwent the most extensive staging procedure, disease-free 5-year survival was 100%.
 For the patients who were inaccurately staged, disease-free 5-year survival was 88%.
 It was concluded that well-differentiated early stage (Ia-IIa) ovarian cancer carries an excellent prognosis after surgical treatment and complete surgical staging, with the possible exception of patients with Stage Ic disease with malignant peritoneal washings.
 Furthermore, it was considered that the application of more objective and consistent ways of assessing tumor grade should be encouraged.
 Surgical staging should be regarded as the golden standard in defining subsets of low-risk patients and should be included and clearly defined in future trials on early ovarian cancer.

365,"Prolonged response to carboplatin in an infant with brain stem glioma.
 Adults and children with brain stem gliomas have a mean survival time of 15 months after radiation therapy (XRT).
 Infants with this tumor present additional complexities for treatment because of possible neurotoxicity of the radiation to the developing brain.
 We report a 15-month-old child with biopsy-proven brain stem glioma with clinical and radiographic evidence of disease progression.
 She was treated with 24 monthly courses of carboplatin without radiation therapy and has had a 39+ month response.
 The clinical response started after 3 months and the radiographic evidence was documented at 10 months by magnetic resonance imaging.
 The toxicity was minimal.
 Longitudinal neuropsychological assessment demonstrated continued improvement at 36 months post diagnosis but with some motor functioning below expected age levels.
 Cervico-medullary astrocytoma in a young patient may be the appropriate clinical setting for future trials of chemotherapy without XRT.

267,"Germ-line transmission of a mutated p53 gene in a cancer-prone family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome 
 Tumour suppressor genes, whose usual function seems to be controlling normal cell proliferation, have been implicated in many inherited and sporadic forms of malignancies Much evidence supports the concept of tumour formation by loss-of-function mutations in suppressor genes, as predicted by the two-hit model of Knudson and DeMars.
 The suppressor gene, p53, is affected in such a manner by numerous mutations, which occur in a variety of human tumours.
 These mutations usually represent the loss of one allele and the substitution of a single base in the other.
 We have now analysed the p53 gene in a family affected by Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by the occurrence of diverse mesenchymal and epithelial neoplasms at multiple sites.
 In some instances the neoplasms seem to be related to exposure to carcinogens, including ionizing radiation.
 The Li-Fraumeni family that we studied had noncancerous skin fibroblasts (NSF) with an unusual radiation-resistant phenotype.
 DNA derived from the NSF cells of four family members, spanning two generations, had the same point mutation in codon 245 (GGC----GAC) of the p53 gene.
 This mutation leads to substitution of aspartic acid for glycine in one of the regions identified as a frequent target of point mutations in p53.
 The NSF cell lines with the mutation also retained the normal p53 allele.
 This inherited p53 mutation may predispose the members of this family to increased susceptibility to cancer.

183,"Papillary cystic neoplasm of the pancreas: radiological and pathological characteristics in 11 cases.
 Clinical charts, radiological features, macroscopic and microscopic findings, and clinical follow-up data were retrospectively reviewed in 11 patients with papillary cystic neoplasm of the pancreas (PCNP).
 The patients were nine women and two men, aged from 13 to 51 years with a mean age of 25 years.
 The greatest diameter of the PCNPs ranged from 2.5 cm to 14.0 cm with a mean size of 7.5 cm.
 Six tumours were located in the tail of the pancreas, two in the body and three in the head.
 Most patients complained of abdominal pain or a mass.
 Ultrasonographic and/or computed tomography findings showed five solid, four mixed (solid and cystic) and two cystic types of tumour.
 Angiographically, PCNP was either a hypovascular or mild hypervascular mass with a displacement of the surrounding vessels.
 No vascular encasement was seen.
 Macroscopically all 11 tumours consisted of a well defined solid mass with degenerative change of various widths, including haemorrhage, necrosis or dystrophic calcification, and were represented by three radiological types of PCNP.
 The 11 patients with PCNP survived for from 3 to 253 months after curative resection without any signs of local recurrence or remote metastasis.
 PCNP usually affects the distal portion of the pancreas of young women.
 Despite its huge size, PCNP should be explored with aggressive surgical intent because of the inherently good prognosis.

768,"Characteristics of erythroleukemia cells selected for vincristine resistance that have accelerated inducer-mediated differentiation.
 The induction of murine erythroleukemia cells (MELC; DS19/Sc9) to terminal differentiation by hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA) is characterized by a latent period of 10-12 hr before onset of commitment to terminal-cell division and increased transcription of globin genes.
 MELC variants, derived from this parental cell line, selected for resistance to vincristine (VC), can be induced to differentiate with little or no latent period.
 This study shows that accelerated HMBA-induced commitment is characteristic of MELC with a low level (2- to 5-fold) of VC resistance in four independently derived cell lines.
 Both resistance to VC and accelerated differentiation are stable phenotypes for at least 50 passages (approximately 5 months) in the absence of VC.
 Low-level VC-resistant MELC do not display increased levels of P-glycoprotein or mdr1, mdr2, and mdr3 mRNAs, nor do they exhibit cross-resistance to colchicine or doxorubicin.
 These cells do show (i) increased level of protein kinase C activity, (ii) reduced accumulation of [3H]VC, and (iii) restoration of VC sensitivity in the presence of verapamil.
 MELC selected for higher levels of VC resistance (approximately 500-fold) do express high levels of P-glycoprotein and the mdr3 gene.
 During HMBA-induced differentiation, DS19/Sc9 decrease [3H]VC accumulation, but P-glycoprotein content does not change.
 A VC-transport-associated protein, also critical for the process of induced differentiation, may be constitutively present in VC-resistant MELC, accounting for their enhanced sensitivity to inducer.
 This protein accumulates by exposure of VC-sensitive cells to HMBA, contributing to their differentiation and decreased level of VC accumulation.

716,"Oral cancer: a survey of 566 cases from the University of Connecticut Oral Pathology Biopsy Service, 1975-1986.
 A survey of the University of Connecticut Oral Pathology Biopsy Service was undertaken to analyze cases of oral cancer accessioned during the 12-year period, 1975 through 1986 inclusive.
 Of 33,429 total specimens accessioned, there were 546 malignant oral neoplasms diagnosed and reported.
 Sixty-five (11.5%) originated from out of state.
 Invasive intraoral squamous cell carcinoma was the predominant tumor (69.7% of total), whereas lip cancer constituted only 2.8% of all malignancies.
 Minor salivary gland adenocarcinomas accounted for 11% of total malignancies whereas verrucous carcinoma, carcinoma in situ, and miscellaneous other forms of oral cancer accounted for the remainder (4.6%, 5.3%, and 6.6%, respectively).
 Cases of invasive squamous cell carcinoma were further analyzed by year, sex distribution, location subsite, age at diagnosis, and histologic grade.
 With the exception of histologic grading, we found that the characterization of cases of squamous cell carcinoma within the biopsy service tended to parallel results from a separate but related statewide analysis of both oral cancer and intraoral squamous cell carcinoma from Connecticut over a much longer time span.
 We concluded that the picture of oral cancer as characterized by cases within the University of Connecticut Oral Pathology Biopsy Service is generally reflective of the disease on a statewide level.

777,"Development of intrapancreatic transplantable model of pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma in Syrian golden hamsters.
 Intrapancreatic and subcutaneous (SC) inoculation of cultured pancreatic cancer cells, derived from an induced primary pancreatic cancer in a Syrian hamster, resulted in tumor take in all recipient hamsters.
 The intrapancreatic allografts grew rapidly, were invasive, and metastasized into the lymph nodes and liver in 2 of 9 cases.
 In comparison, SC tumors grew relatively slower and formed a large encapsulated mass without invasion and metastases.
 Histologically, tumors of both sites showed fairly well-differentiated adenocarcinomas of ductal/ductular type resembling the induced primary cancer.
 Similar to the primary induced pancreatic cancers, tumor cells of both allografts expressed blood-group-related antigens, including A, B, H, Le(b), Le(y), Le(x), and tumor-associated antigen TAG-72.
 The tumor cells did not express Le(a), CA 19-9, 17-1A, or DU-PAN-2.
 The expression of these antigens was retained in the metastases and presented the same patterns of reactivity as the allografts.
 Thus intrapancreatic transplantation provides a rapid model for production of pancreatic cancer with morphologic similarities to human pancreatic cancer.

549,"Proliferation and DNA ploidy in malignant breast tumors in relation to early oral contraceptive use and early abortions.
 In 175 premenopausal breast cancer patients, a history of oral contraceptive (OC) use before 20 years of age was significantly associated with higher tumor cell proliferative activity, as indicated by a higher S-phase fraction (SPF), and a higher fraction of DNA aneuploid tumors, compared with later or never users (P = 0.05 and p = 0.01, respectively).
 The higher SPF among early OC users was apparent in patients with aneuploid tumors but not in patients with euploid tumors.
 Abortions (spontaneous or induced) before the first full-term pregnancy also were associated with a higher SPF compared with other young patients with breast cancer (P = 0.03).
 Adjusting for parity and abortions or OC use, respectively, an early OC use was associated with a 43% higher SPF and early abortions were associated with 49% higher SPF.
 Younger patients had a higher SPF and a higher frequency of aneuploid tumors, but this was found to be because the users of OC had a lower median age at diagnosis.
 Among never users, no significant age relationship was seen for SPF or the frequency of aneuploidy.
 For the DNA analyses there is a selection of patients with breast cancer with larger tumors, and therefore the conclusions drawn in this article may not be generalizable to patients with smaller primary tumors, e.g., cases diagnosed at breast cancer screening.
 The higher tumor proliferative activity and frequency of aneuploidy in early OC users are in line with previously reported findings of worse prognostic indicators and a worse survival in early users of OC compared with other young women with breast cancer.

720,"Surgical management of 552 carcinomas of the extrahepatic bile ducts (gallbladder and periampullary tumors excluded). Results of the French Surgical Association Survey.
 Five hundred fifty-two cases of primary carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts (gallbladder and periampullary tumors excluded) collected from 55 surgical centers were reviewed retrospectively.
 Three hundred seven patients (56%) had upper-third lesions (proximal carcinoma), whereas 71 (13%) and 101 (18%), respectively, had middle-third and lower-third bile duct carcinomas.
 The remaining patients had diffuse lesions.
 Resectability rates were 32% for upper-third localization compared to 47% and 51% for middle-third and lower-third localization, respectively.
 The operative mortality rate for proximal carcinomas was significantly lower with resection (16%) compared with palliative surgery (31%) (p less than 0.05).
 Overall 1-year survival (operative deaths excluded) was 68% after tumor resection compared to 31% after palliative surgery (p less than 0.001).
 Long-term results after surgical resection correlated with local and regional extension of the disease.
 The results of this study show that resection of extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas, particularly in an upper-third localization, often is associated with worthwhile long-term survival.

 Eleven patients suffering from cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) were treated with recombinant interferon alpha-2A in combination (seven patients) or alone.
 Two patients, one in combined treatment, went into clinical complete remission, and five experienced partial remission.
 Two patients progressed during therapy, and two were nonevaluable because they stopped treatment early due to side effects.
 Dosages of interferon were from 3 to 36 million units daily for 3 months, and thereafter 3 times weekly.
 Etretinate (0.7 mg/kg) was given orally.
 The study showed that recombinant interferon alpha-2A in combination with etretinate or alone can induce remission of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

316,"Molecular surgery of the basement membrane by the argon laser.
 Although the argon laser is used successfully to weld a number of different tissues, the underlying chemical and cellular mechanisms for this process are not precisely defined.
 Consequently, a biochemical model has been developed in vitro using the well-defined extracellular matrix from the murine Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) sarcoma.
 Control and experimental samples of EHS basement membranes were irradiated with a Trimedyne argon laser at 500-3,000 Joules/cm2 at 0 degrees C.
 The samples were diluted into cold phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to gel at 35 degrees C.
 The time course of the gelation reaction was followed in a spectrophotometer at 360 nm.
 Irradiation reduced the absorbance 7.5-15% compared to controls and was independent of the dilution over a 10-fold range.
 Gelation was also measured by determining the amount of protein by the Bradford assay that could be collected by centrifugation at 10,000g for 10 minutes.
 Argon-irradiated samples had 30-40% less protein in the precipitate than the controls.
 The addition of 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol to the EHS extract blocked the effect of the laser on the gelation reaction.
 In addition, when gelation was carried out in the absence of calcium and magnesium, there were no differences between laser-treated samples and controls.
 The basement membrane proteins were separated by electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gels under denaturing plus reducing or denaturing and non-reducing conditions.
 No differences in the polypeptide composition were noted between irradiated and control samples using either Coomassie- or silver-staining techniques.

 DNA flow cytometry (FCM) was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of 38 surgically resected colorectal carcinomas (CRC).
 Forty-seven percent of tumors exhibited aneuploidy and 53% were diploid.
 Seventy-two percent of patients in the aneuploid but only 35% in the diploid group were alive after a mean follow-up of 30.7 and 28.8 months (p = 0.01), and 5-yr survival of 56.7% and 11.7%, respectively (p less than 0.05).
 The site of tumor location, Dukes' stage, and serum CEA level did not predict a certain DNA stemline.
 However, irrespective of the ploidy pattern, a serum CEA level greater than 5.0 was associated with a higher mortality and poor 5-yr survival (p less than 0.005).
 Similarly, advanced Dukes' stage was associated with higher mortality (p less than 0.05).
 Forty-six percent of the patients with lesions that were Dukes' B2 or advanced stage received adjuvant therapy.
 Eighty-five percent of this subgroup of patients died; 18% of these patients had aneuploid tumors.
 The role of FCM in the assessment of prognosis of CRC deserves further clinical evaluation in a randomized control trial.

776,"Beta-carotene's effects on serum lipoproteins and immunologic indices in humans.
 Doses of beta-carotene for cancer-prevention trials have been chosen based on epidemiologic data.
 Mechanisms of the putative antineoplastic effects by beta-carotene are unknown but may involve modulation of the immune system.
 We measured plasma carotenoid concentrations and selected immunologic indices at baseline and at 2 and 4 wk in 50 healthy humans (5 groups of 10 each) ingesting 0, 15, 45, 180, or 300 mg beta-carotene/d for 1 mo in this randomized placebo-controlled, open-label, parallel study.
 Plasma beta-carotene concentrations were markedly increased by 2 wk and were correlated with dose.
 Beta-carotene concentrations plateaued between 2 and 4 wk except for the 300-mg group.
 Thus, we developed a dose-concentration curve to optimize beta-carotene-dose selection to achieve target plasma concentrations.
 We were unable to identify any effects of beta-carotene ingestion on the immunologic indices studied, but modest increases in high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol were observed in all beta-carotene-treated groups.

344,"The impact of physician compliance on screening mammography for older women.
 Screening mammography is underutilized, even for women older than 50 years for whom there is a general consensus that regular annual screening is appropriate and necessary.
 To evaluate reasons for this underutilization, we studied a random sample of 517 women in Los Angeles, Calif who were older than 50 years.
 All women were found to be underscreened, especially women older than 65 years.
 For example, approximately 35% of women 50 to 64 years old and 47% of women aged 65 years and older never had had even one mammogram.
 Analyses revealed that the most important factor that predicted whether a women ever had had a mammogram was whether her physician had talked to her about mammography.
 Women were between four and 12 times more likely, depending on their age group, to have had a mammogram at some time if their physicians discussed it with them.
 The discussions did not need to be lengthy or complex.
 These results indicate that physicians need to know that discussing screening mammography with their patients has a major impact on breast cancer screening behaviors.

 A phase I trial of piritrexim was conducted by use of a prolonged, low-dose oral schedule.
 A number of different regimens were tested, including daily dosing for 21 days followed by 7 days of no drug therapy; continuous dosing; and daily dosing for 5 of 7 days for 3 consecutive weeks followed by a week of rest.
 Dose escalation was accomplished by increasing the dosing frequency from once a day to twice a day and then to three times a day and by increasing the number of days of administration.
 Fifty-one patients with advanced cancer were entered in the study.

 Research on the relevance of social support to cancer has been plentiful since the first American Cancer Society workshop on methodological issues in behavioral and psychosocial science.
 Nonetheless, critical shortcomings continue to characterize the attempt empirically to establish such things as the extent to which social support predicts adjustment to cancer diagnosis and treatment.
 Prominent among these is the failure to adequately address large elements of the social structure, such as social class and urbanization, and to investigate how they shape the well being of persons with or at risk for cancer and their caregivers.
 We recommend that more psychosocial research on the link between social support and cancer be conducted within populations beset by poverty and without adequate access to health care.

 The current role of liver transplantation in treating malignant tumors of the liver is uncertain, except for select histologic types.
 Pooled data on the results of liver transplantation in 12 children with hepatoblastoma is presented here.
 One half of the children are alive 24 to 70 (44 +/- 19) months after transplantation with no evidence of recurrence.
 Three patients (25%) died of tumor recurrence and three (25%) died of other causes.
 Unifocal and intrahepatic tumors were associated with better prognosis compared to the multifocal tumors and tumors with extrahepatic spread (p = 0.04 and 0.13).
 Microscopically vascular invasion and the predominance of embryonal and/or anaplastic epithelium were associated with a poor prognosis compared to the tumors with no vascular invasion and with predominantly fetal epithelium (p = 0.08 and 0.1).

 IT-066 (10-60 micrograms/kg) given i.v.
 inhibited histamine-stimulated acid secretion dose-dependently in gastric lumen-perfused rats, and the inhibitory effect was observed for about 12 hr.
 Famotidine (FMD) (10-60 micrograms/kg i.v.) also had an antisecretory effect, but the acid secretion recovered to the control level 4 hr after the administration.
 Cold stress plus indomethacin-induced lesion was significantly inhibited by IT-066 and FMD given i.v.
 30 min before the cold stress plus indomethacin treatment.
 IT-066 given 7 hr before the cold stress plus indomethacin treatment also inhibited lesion formation significantly, but such antilesional effect was not observed with FMD.
 In the rat isolated gastric mucosal sheet, IT-066 inhibited histamine-stimulated acid secretion dose-dependently and noncompetitively; its action was produced via a unique mechanism.
 The inhibitory effect of IT-066 remained after washing of the mucosa, and became more potent time-dependently.
 The inhibitory effects of FMD and cimetidine were not observed after washing the mucosa.
 These data suggest that IT-066 has a potent and long lasting antisecretory effect in vivo and in vitro, and that these properties are responsible for the long lasting antilesional action.

696,"Stimulation of cAMP and phosphomonoester production by melanotropin in melanoma cells: 31P NMR studies.
 A major part of the present understanding of the molecular basis of signal transduction has been gained from in vitro studies using classical biochemical methods.
 In this study, we used 31P NMR spectroscopy to investigate the response of live M2R mouse melanoma cells to stimulation by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH; melanotropin).
 In the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and a synergistic dose of forskolin (1.67 microM), MSH induced a transient (approximately 60-min) rise in the cellular concentration of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which coincided in time with an equivalent decrease (approximately 40%) in ATP.
 However, no detectable change in phosphocreatine concentration was observed.
 Concomitantly, MSH induced a striking and unexpected increase in the concentration of three phosphomonoester (PME) metabolites (approximately 2-fold increase in total PME signal area); one signal has been assigned to phosphoethanolamine.
 The levels of the PMEs remained high for 2-4 hr and declined slowly (approximately 10 hr) to basal level, following perfusion with fresh culture medium.
 The increase in PME was also observed after stimulation with MSH alone.
 In contrast, stimulation with a high dose of forskolin (50 microM) and isobutylmethylxanthine (0.2 mM), although effective in stimulating the production of cAMP, did not induce the PME response.
 Evaluation of the cells' energetics indicated that the enhanced production of phosphoethanolamine is probably not due to ethanolamine phosphorylation.
 Therefore, it is likely to result from hydrolysis of phosphatidylethanolamine by a specific phospholipase C.
 The response of the PMEs appears to be regulated by a cAMP-independent process, suggesting the existence of an alternative transduction pathway controlled by MSH.

456,"Insulin-like growth factors are mitogenic for human keratinocytes and a squamous cell carcinoma.
 Normal adult human keratinocytes in monolayer culture and SCL-1, a skin-derived squamous-cell carcinoma cell line, were investigated for the expression of receptors for insulin-like growth factors (IGF) and insulin.
 As demonstrated by affinity crosslinking, radiolabeled IGF-1, IGF-2, and insulin bound specifically to both cell types.
 Each cell expressed type I IGF receptors, with affinity for IGF-1 greater than IGF-2 much greater than insulin.
 Insulin receptors, with highest affinity for insulin, were also present on both cells.
 However, keratinocytes and SCL-1 cells differed in 125I-IGF-2 binding.
 125I-IGF-2-bound to both type I and type II IGF receptors in normal keratinocytes, but bound predominantly to membrane-associated IGF binding proteins in SCL-1.
 IGF-1 was slightly more potent than IGF-2 in stimulating growth of both keratinocytes and SCL-1 cells.
 In keratinocytes, concentrations of IGF-1 ranging from 5-100 ng/ml, and of IGF-2 from 50-100 ng/ml, resulted in a significant increase in cell number.
 At the maximum dose of 100 ng/ml, either IGF-1 or IGF-2 caused a 2.3-times increase in cell number.
 In SCL-1 cells, IGF-1 was more potent than IGF-2 or insulin at lower concentrations, but either IGF-1 or IGF-2 at the maximal concentration of 333 ng/ml stimulated a 4.7-times increase in thymidine incorporation.
 The stimulatory effect of insulin in SCL-1 was 10-50 times less potent than that of the IGF.
 The effect of either IGF on SCL-1 was completely inhibited by the type I IGF receptor antibody alpha IR-3, suggesting that both IGFs are mitogenic through the type I IGF receptor.
 Insulin action was partially blocked by alpha IR-3, suggesting that insulin can act through both the insulin and type I IGF receptors.
 It thus appears that IGF-1 and IGF-2 are mitogens for normal and transformed human keratinocytes and that their actions are primarily mediated through the type I IGF receptor, whereas insulin is a mitogen through both the IGF-1 receptor and the insulin receptor.

 Targeting of radioactivity to tumors using antitumor antibodies is evolving from a laboratory curiosity toward a practical diagnostic and therapeutic technique that promises widespread benefits for many common human cancers.
 The development of the hybridoma technique by Kohler and Milstein for producing monoclonal antibodies is probably the single most important contribution to the development of this field.
 A large array of monoclonal antibodies against many human tumors have been created and labeled with a variety of radioisotopes; 110 clinical trials have been identified from the literature between the interval of 1978 to the present.
 These studies are beginning to form the basis for certain conclusions regarding likely benefits for certain combinations of antitumor antibodies and isotopes in specific instances of clinical management in patients with malignant neoplasms.
 For example, in melanoma, lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and colorectal malignancies, radiolabeled antibodies have demonstrated occult tumors, which could not be disclosed with conventional methodologies.
 Radioimmunotherapy of malignant lymphoma is achieving durable remissions in patients who have failed conventional forms of therapy.
 For the most part, these advances have been achieved through intelligent application of known principles of immunochemistry, imaging physics, and tumor immunology.
 Progress has been slow but steady.
 In a few instances, the term ""magic bullet"" is warranted in describing the targeting of a particular radiolabeled antibody to a human tumor.
 I-131, 3-F8, an IgG3 against the GD2 antigen of neuroblastoma, which was introduced by Cheung, and In-111 T-101, against the CD5 antigen of T-cells, which was developed by Royston, stand out because of the consistency and high concentration of radioactive targeting to human tumors in clinical trials.
 If certain technical innovations fulfill their initial promise, the future will be bright for radioimmunologic methods of diagnosis and therapy.
 Genetic engineering will permit the development of ""humanized"" antibodies with biologic properties that favor tumor localization.
 New chemical approaches will broaden the range of isotopes available as diagnostic and therapeutic radiolabels.
 Application of modern imaging methodologies, such as positron emission tomography (PET), will detect more lesions of smaller size and permit quantitative imaging for dosimetry considerations.
 Greater speed and ease of use of computerized work stations will lead to the broader application of fusion imaging in which radioantibody images will be viewed simultaneously with TCT or MRI for better anatomic correlation of abnormal sites of antigen-reactive tumor deposits.

210,"Malignant melanoma occurring during pregnancy: a report of the Northern Israel Oncology Center (1968-1988).
 Medical records of seven patients treated within a 20 year period for malignant melanoma during pregnancy were reviewed.
 No significant detrimental prognostic effects could be attributed to pregnancy.
 The current literature on melanoma and pregnancy is discussed.
 Based on this, pregnancy seems not to be contraindicated in melanoma patients.

687,"Expression of laminin and its receptor LBP-32 in human and rat hepatoma cells.
 Dramatic cellular changes that occur during hepatocarcinogenesis are associated with major alterations in extracellular matrix formation and in the relationships between cells and their microenvironment.
 We have studied the expression of laminin, the major noncollagenous glycoprotein of basement membrane, and the laminin receptor 32 kD laminin-binding protein in two rat (Faza 967 and HTC) and two human (HepG2 and HBGC2) hepatoma cell lines that express a variety of liver-specific functions.
 Laminin was found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of these cells when the indirect immunoperoxidase method and electron microscopic examination were used.
 Radiolabeled laminin, immunoprecipitated from both media and cell extracts, was resolved by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel in two major polypeptides that comigrated with the A and B subunits from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor laminin.
 Immunoblot analysis showed that the Mr = 400,000 polypeptide did not correspond to the A subunit of laminin.
 Northern blot analyses demonstrated large amounts of B1 and B2 mRNAs but no A chain mRNA.
 We conclude that the tumor cells produce the laminin B chains only.
 In contrast, normal adult hepatocytes from either man or rat lacked laminin mRNAs, whereas in 1-day primary culture, B chain mRNAs became detectable.
 The steady-state level of 32 kD laminin-binding protein mRNA was 10-fold and threefold higher in rat hepatoma cells than in freshly isolated and 1-day cultured normal rat hepatocytes, respectively.
 In human hepatocytes, the steady-state levels of 32 kD laminin-binding protein mRNAs varied depending on the donor and never reached the level of the human hepatoma cells.

751,"The influence of drug interval on the effect of methotrexate and fluorouracil in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer 
 The importance of the interval between methotrexate (MTX) and fluorouracil (5-FU) was studied in 168 patients with previously untreated, measurable, advanced colorectal cancer.
 They were randomized to receive MTX 200 mg/m2, followed by 5-FU 600 mg/m2 either 24 hours (arm A) or 1 hour (arm B) after MTX.
 All patients received leucovorin (LV) 24 hours after MTX, 10 mg/m2 orally every 6 hours for six doses.
 The regimen was repeated every 2 weeks, with 5-FU escalation as tolerated.
 Arm A was significantly better than arm B with respect to overall response rate (29% v 14.5%, P = .026), time to progression (TTP; median, 9.9 months v 5.9 months, P = .009), and survival (median, 15.3 months v 11.4 months, P = .003).
 Significant differences between arms were not found in response rate, median TTP, or median survival for the subgroup of patients with rectal primaries who comprised 20% of the patients in each arm.
 Significant factors prognostic for survival were performance status and number of metastases, as well as treatment.
 Age did not influence survival.
 Toxicity was similar in both arms and was primarily gastrointestinal.
 More mucositis was seen in arm A.
 There were four toxic deaths secondary to neutropenia and infection (one from arm A and three from arm B) and three other deaths (two from arm A and one from arm B) that were possibly drug-related.
 The combination of MTX with LV rescue and 5-FU is an active regimen in advanced colorectal cancer; its efficacy is increased in colon, but not rectal cancer, when the interval between MTX and 5-FU is long (24 hours) rather than short (1 hour).

205,"N-[18F]fluoroacetyl-D-glucosamine: a potential agent for cancer diagnosis 
 Positron labeled substrates such as sugars, amino acids, and nucleosides have been investigated for the in-vivo evaluation of biochemical processes in cancerous tissue.
 Hexosamines are obligatory structural components of many biologically important macromolecules, including membrane glycoproteins and mucopolysaccharide.
 We evaluated a new synthesized pharmaceutical, N-[18F]fluoroacetyl-D-glucosamine (18F-FAG), which is a structural analog of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.
 C3H/HeMsNRS mice bearing spontaneous hepatomas were used for the tissue distribution study.
 At 60 min after injection, high uptakes were found in tumor (5.16, mean value of %dose/g), liver (3.71), and kidney (3.27).
 The tumor uptake of 18F-FAG showed the highest value in all tissue.
 In the PET study, VX-2 carcinoma of the rabbit was clearly visualized.
 Our preliminary results suggest that 18F-FAG has potential as a new agent for tumor imaging.

363,"A Southwest Oncology Group study on the use of a human tumor cloning assay for predicting response in patients with ovarian cancer.
 A total of 211 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (168 with tumors refractory to prior chemotherapy and 43 with no prior chemotherapy) from 33 different Southwest Oncology Group institutions had their tumors sampled and specimens shipped to two central laboratories for drug-sensitivity testing in a human tumor cloning assay.
 The 168 patients with a prior history of chemotherapy failure (median of four prior chemotherapeutic agents) were treated with the most effective agent(s) found in the cloning assay (23 patients), and those patients whose tumors did not form colonies in vitro or did not manifest any sensitivity to agent(s) were treated with a clinician's choice of agent(s) (101 patients).
 The remaining 44 of the 168 patients were not treated with chemotherapy because of deteriorating performance status or early death.
 The complete and partial response rate in patients treated according to assay results was 28% versus 11% for the patients treated according to clinician's choice (P = 0.03).
 There was no statistically significant difference in survival between the two options (6.25 versus 7 months, respectively).
 The 43 patients with no history of prior chemotherapy were all treated with standard combination chemotherapy, and their clinical response was compared with their in vitro sensitivity to the same agents.
 Overall there was a 100% true-positive rate and 100% true-negative rate for the seven evaluable patients.
 From these data the authors conclude that use of the human tumor cloning assay may increase the response rate but not the survival for selected patients with advanced chemotherapy-refractory ovarian cancer.
 The study is weakened, however, by the many steps of patient selection necessitated by inadequate tumor colony formation in vitro and the inability to treat all patients (because of early death or a rapid decline in performance status).
 The assay does appear to be worthy of additional study for predicting response to combination chemotherapy in patients without a prior history of chemotherapy.
 Finally the use of central chemosensitivity testing laboratories is feasible for testing in vitro predictive assays in a cooperative group setting.

654,"MHC-restricted recognition of autologous melanoma by tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells. Evidence for restriction by a dominant HLA-A allele.
 Autologous melanoma-specific CTL recognize a common tumor-associated Ag (TAA) in the context of HLA class I antigens.
 We have demonstrated that HLA-A2 can be a restricting Ag and, in T cell lines homozygous for HLA-A2, that CTL can be generated by stimulation with HLA-A2 allogeneic melanomas.
 In the current study, we have investigated T cell lines from patients who are heterozygous at HLA-A region locus, to determine the relative importance of each A-region allele in this MHC-restricted recognition of tumor.
 We have shown that HLA-A1 can be a restricting Ag, and that allogeneic melanomas expressing HLA-A1 can substitute for the autologous tumor in the generation of HLA-A1-restricted CTL.
 However, when T cell lines express both HLA-A1 and HLA-A2, the HLA-A2 allele governed restriction of the melanoma TAA.
 Three autologous-stimulated HLA-A1, A2 CTL lines all demonstrated restriction by the HLA-A2 allele, when examined in cytotoxicity assays, cold-competition assays, and proliferation assays.
 There was no evidence of restriction by the second HLA-allele, HLA-A1.
 Although the autologous-stimulated CTL use a single A-region allele for tumor recognition, the autologous HLA-A1, A2 tumors are lysed by both HLA-A1-restricted and HLA-A2-restricted CTL.
 The dominance of restricting alleles was further demonstrated when HLA-matched allogeneic melanomas were used as the stimulating tumor to generate tumor-specific CTL.
 Stimulation of the heterozygous (HLA-A1, A2) lymphocytes with HLA-A2-matched allogeneic melanomas resulted in CTL specific for the autologous tumor, and restricted by the HLA-A2 Ag.
 However, stimulation with an HLA-A1-matched allogeneic melanoma failed to induce tumor-specific CTL restricted by the HLA-A1 Ag.
 The data suggest there is a dominance of HLA-A region Ag at the level of the T cell, such that only one is restricting in the recognition of the autologous melanoma.
 At the level of the tumor, however, the TAA is expressed in the context of both HLA-A region alleles.
 We can generate specific CTL from lymph node cells or PBL and HLA-A region matched allogeneic melanomas; however, because most patients are heterozygous at the HLA-A region locus, an understanding of the dominant restricting alleles must be obtained so that an appropriately matched allogeneic melanoma can be selected.

285,"Etoposide in the management of metastatic breast cancer.
 Etoposide, despite extensive use in other malignancies, has played a minor role in the treatment of patients with breast cancer.
 Single-agent trials in which etoposide is administered to heavily pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer have demonstrated a low overall response rate (6.6% of 383 patients), with no convincing evidence for either schedule dependence or a relationship between dose intensity and response.
 The sole single-agent trial in previously untreated patients suggested that the drug has an approximately 15% response rate in untreated patients.
 Combination therapy trials in which etoposide has been combined with either cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, or cisplatin have not yet convincingly demonstrated superiority over any of these drugs as single agents, although cisplatin plus etoposide appears to be superior to either agent alone.
 In vitro studies suggest that pretreating hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells with estradiol may increase their sensitivity to etoposide-induced DNA cleavage.
 This may represent a future direction in the use of etoposide in breast cancer.
 Currently, however, the use of etoposide in breast cancer should be considered investigational.

244,"Control of interleukin-1 beta expression by protein kinase C and cyclic adenosine monophosphate in myeloid leukemia cells.
 We have examined the signal transduction pathways leading to the expression of the interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) gene in human myeloid leukemia cells lines.
 Two cell lines representing different stages of differentiation were used (HL-60, promyelocytic, and THP-1, mature monocytic).
 In accordance with previous studies, it was observed that a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), was a sufficient stimulus for induction of the IL-1 beta messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and IL-1 beta protein production in both of these cell lines.
 A structural analog of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbcAMP) or agents elevating the endogenous cAMP levels (prostaglandin E2, forskolin) were not alone able to induce IL-1 beta expression, but they strongly enhanced the PMA-induced IL-1 beta production and IL-1 beta mRNA accumulation.
 Nuclear run off analysis showed that this elevation in IL-1 beta mRNA levels was due to an increased rate of transcription.
 If dbcAMP was added 6 hours before PMA to the cultures, no enhancement in the IL-1 beta production was seen, implying that for this enhancing effect both of these signals must be present simultaneously.
 PKC inhibitor, H7, also blocked effectively the PMA plus dbcAMP induced IL-1 beta production, while the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, HA1004, had no effect, suggesting that PKA activation is not involved in the mechanism of action of cAMP in this case.
 Collectively, the present findings show that cAMP-dependent signals can have a positive regulatory effect on the PKC-dependent activation of the IL-1 beta gene in cells derived from different stages of myeloid differentiation.

671,"Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: prospective assessment of abdominal US in the localization of gastrinomas.
 The ability of abdominal ultrasound (US) to help localize gastrinomas was prospectively studied in 79 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
 The results were assessed by means of laparotomy, autopsy, or percutaneous liver biopsy.
 For hepatic gastrinoma, US had a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 100%, with a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 89%.
 US was slightly less sensitive for detecting gastrinoma in the liver than were computed tomography (CT) (66%) and selective angiography (78%).
 For detection of extrahepatic gastrinoma, US had a sensitivity of 30%, a specificity of 94%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 25%.
 US enabled detection of tumor in eight cases not detected with CT and in four not detected with angiography.
 Specificity for extrahepatic gastrinoma was similar for all three modalities (89%-95%).
 CT and US were equally effective for the detection of extrahepatic gastrinoma, and angiography was significantly more effective than both US and CT (P less than .01).
 The authors conclude that US, although of low sensitivity, remains useful as the initial imaging modality in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

426,"Total sacrectomy and reconstruction for huge sacral tumors.
 The authors carried out successful total sacrectomy in three cases, two with giant cell tumors and one with a chordoma.
 The anterior and posterior approach is feasible for resecting huge sacral tumors en bloc, but it is important to reconstruct the continuity between the pelvic ring and spinal column using spinal instrumentation and sacral rods or AO plates.
 As total sacrectomy is a large-scale, time-consuming, and collaborative operation, two or three teams should be used in relays.
 Both pelvic and spinal surgical techniques are required.
 Post-operatively the patient can stand within 3 to 6 months and well-planned rehabilitation allows ambulation.
 In spite of the serious structural and neurologic damage caused, total sacrectomy can be rewarding procedure in terms of improved morbidity and mortality.

429,"Dissection of the cardinal ligament in radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer with emphasis on the lateral ligament.
 Surgical experience with carcinomas of the uterus and rectum has provided new insights into the surgical anatomy of a lamina, which separates the paravesical space from the pararectal space.
 It has been proved that each of the lamina consists of the cardinal and lateral ligaments and pelvic splanchnic nerves, descending in the following order.
 The cardinal and lateral ligaments, as a connective stalk, insert into the lateral walls of the uterus and rectum extending from the inner aspect of the pelvic wall.
 Clarification of this structural relationship led to the development of a new procedure for the dissection of the cardinal ligament in radical hysterectomy, while still preserving the lateral ligament.
 This facilitated systematic dissection of the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments with posterior manipulation, leading to a reduction in blood loss and to prevention of brisk bleeding from the venous plexuses.

282,"Etoposide. Current and future status.
 Etoposide (VP-16-213) is an antineoplastic agent with demonstrated efficacy against a broad spectrum of human malignancies, including testicular, germ cell, lung, and other cancers.
 Etoposide can be synergistic with other agents.
 As part of combination chemotherapy, etoposide has become a so-called standard in therapies for testicular cancer and small cell lung cancer.
 Its activity in tumors such as lymphoma and leukemia, as well as solid tumors, identifies etoposide as a highly important chemotherapeutic agent.
 Cellular and animal models have shown that the cell kill and tumor response depend on both dose and time of exposure.
 Recent clinical studies again show that dose and schedule of etoposide can have important effects on clinical response to the drug.
 Further research should now continue: (1) on the use of etoposide as part of initial therapy in several cancers, and (2) in higher doses and prolonged schedules to optimize this agent's potential.

736,"Nuclear shape as a prognostic discriminant in colorectal carcinoma.
 In search for a more reliable prognostic discriminant, a retrospective analysis of 100 cases of colorectal carcinoma having undergone curative resection and followed for at least 5 years were assessed by nuclear morphometry.
 Each case was staged according to the Dukes' classification as well as graded histologically.
 For all patients in this series, the perimeter, area, and nuclear shape factor of 50 interphase nuclei were determined for each carcinoma.
 The information was obtained through the use of an image analysis system by tracing the nuclear profiles (magnification 1000x) as digitized on a video screen.
 The nuclear shape factor was defined as the degree of circularity of the nucleus, a perfect circle recorded as 1.0.
 A nuclear shape factor greater than 0.84 was associated with poor outcome.
 Multiple regression models showed that the single nuclear parameter of the shape factor was the most highly significant predictor of survival (P less than 0.0001).
 This variable remained highly significant even when corrected for sex, age, histologic grade, and Dukes' classification.
 These findings indicate that a nuclear shape factor greater than or equal to 0.84 as determined by nuclear morphometry is an independent morphometric nuclear variable of great importance in the prognosis of large bowel carcinoma.

537,"The natural history of colorectal cancer. Opportunities for intervention.
 There is now a better understanding of the natural history of colorectal cancer, which has provided a basis for intervention to influence outcome.
 The possible interventions include earlier detection of colorectal cancer, removal of premalignant adenomas, demonstration of the mucosal field defect that precedes neoplasia to evaluate baseline risk and its change with dietary modification, and identification of inherited and dietary risk factors.
 Five controlled trials evaluating early detection of colorectal cancer with fecal occult blood testing have enrolled more than 309,000 patients.
 Early stage cancers with improved survival has been observed, but data on mortality reduction have not as yet been reported.
 Studies of patients with adenomas have demonstrated high synchronous and metachronous rates as a basis for complete colon evaluation initially and a surveillance follow-up program.
 Hyperproliferation and lack of normal differentiation have been observed as a field defect in the colon preceding neoplasia.
 Inherited factors have recently been shown to be important in a larger proportion of individuals destined to develop colorectal adenomas and cancer.
 These observations of the natural history of colorectal cancer have provided new opportunities for the application of radiologic and endoscopic techniques in diagnosis and surveillance; each examination has its merit.
 Further research is needed to answer many critical questions that have been raised regarding the impact of these interventions.

390,"Primary treatment of large and massive adult sarcomas with iododeoxyuridine and aggressive hyperfractionated irradiation.
 For a decade, the authors have experimented with treatment for unresectable adult soft tissue and bony sarcomas.
 Over the last 6 years, they have combined hyperfractionated radiation therapy and intravenous iododeoxyuridine as a radiosensitizer, in regimens designed to minimize toxicity and permit delivery of aggressive radiation therapy.
 Patients with solitary lesions and those with metastasis (38%) were treated in the hope of both potential cure in some and durable palliation in others.
 The most formidable of these cancers have been those that are large or massive, often requiring five or more fields and extensive treatment planning.
 The authors report results from 36 patients with large unresectable sarcomas (tumors ranging from 5 to 35 cm; average 14 cm) treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year, follow-up of 4 or more years (in 50%), or follow-up until death.
 Overall local control has been 60%, with control of 66% of lesions from 5 to 9 cm, 63% of those from 10 to 14 cm, 63% of those from 15 to 19 cm, and 57% of those greater than 20 to 40 cm.

 In a prospective study of 8881 postmenopausal female residents of a retirement community in southern California, we evaluated in detail the relationship between estrogen use and overall mortality.
 After 7 1/2 years of follow-up, there had been 1447 deaths.
 Women with a history of estrogen use had 20% lower age-adjusted, all-cause mortality than lifetime nonusers (95% confidence interval, 0.70 to 0.87).
 Mortality decreased with increasing duration of use and was lower among current users than among women who used estrogens only in the distant past.
 Current users with more than 15 years of estrogen use had a 40% reduction in their overall mortality.
 Among oral estrogen users, relative risks of death could not be distinguished by specific dosages of the oral estrogen taken for the longest time.
 Women who had used estrogen replacement therapy had a reduced mortality from all categories of acute and chronic arteriosclerotic disease and cerebrovascular disease.
 This group of women had a reduced mortality from cancer, although this reduction was not statistically significant.
 The mortality from all remaining causes combined was the same in estrogen users and lifetime nonusers.

 There were 12 boys, and the median age was 5.7 years (range, 0.8 to 21.8 years).
 Tumor histology included 8 primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), 3 ependymomas, 2 low-grade astrocytomas, 1 anaplastic astrocytoma, 1 glioblastoma multiforme, 1 atypical rhabdoid tumor, and 1 malignant fibrous histiocytoma.
 Thirteen tumors originated in the posterior fossa, 2 were supratentorial, and 2 were in the spinal cord.
 The median interval between the 2 diagnostic tests was 2 days.
 MRI + Gd was positive in 11 (65%), Myelo + CT in 8 (47%), and CSF in 5 (29%) cases.
 MRI + Gd was superior in delineating spinal cord nodules and ""sugar coating"" whereas Myelo + CT more readily revealed nerve root sleeve filling defects.
 There was no case in which Myelo + CT was positive that MRI + Gd did not reveal SAMD.
 MRI + Gd is a safe, noninvasive test that should be used as the initial imaging modality for the presence of SAMD.

 From January 1986 to December 1988, a prospective trial of transcatheter arterial treatment was carried out for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
 Two hundred seventy-five patients were included.
 Okuda's staging system was employed.
 Patients with Stage I and II HCC were treated by transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) with a gelatin sponge containing an anti-cancer agent (protocol 1a); a gelatin sponge and iodized oil mixed with an anti-cancer agent (protocol 1b); or iodized oil mixed with an anti-cancer agent (protocol 2).
 Patients with Stage III HCC were treated with iodized oil with anti-cancer agent (protocol 2).
 As an exception, patients with an unsuccessful superselective catheterization into the proper hepatic artery by Seldinger technique or obstruction of the main trunk of the portal vein were treated with percutaneous transcatheter arterial infusion into the common hepatic artery regardless of stage (protocol 3).
 Tumor type and extension, area of tumor involvement, portal vein involvement, method of treatment, and presence of ascites and icterus were found to be the significant factors for an initial response to therapy.
 Treatment method was the most important factor.
 Respective survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 70.9% and 55.3% for protocol 1a; 62.3% and 43.8% for protocol 1b; 37.8% and 18.3% for protocol 2; and 16.5% and 0% for protocol 3.

 The bursa of the tibial collateral ligament (TCL) may be visualized at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging when it becomes distended with fluid.
 In the authors' experience, this finding signifies a pathologic condition either in the medial capsuloligamentous complex or in the bursa itself.
 Such a finding may indicate TCL bursitis.
 TCL bursitis can be suspected in the setting of isolated pain in the medial joint line in the absence of mechanical symptoms.
 Prolonged relief of symptoms after injection of steroid into the bursa is supportive of the diagnosis.
 Seven cases are presented in which a fluid-filled TCL bursa was identified at MR imaging.
 In five cases, TCL bursitis was suspected.

848,"Effect of a single infusion of aminohydroxypropylidene on calcium and bone metabolism in healthy volunteers monitored during 2 months.
 Recently, bisphosphonates have been used to prevent postmenopausal bone loss.
 As the effects of bisphosphonates on normal bone metabolism are unknown, 3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene-1,1-diphosphonate (APD) was studied in healthy subjects.
 The effects of a single 20-mg APD infusion on biochemical parameters of calcium and bone metabolism were investigated during 2 months in 10 healthy male volunteers.
 This single moderate dose of APD reduced biochemical parameters of bone resorption during the time of follow-up.
 After 2 months, urinary hydroxyproline excretion was still below the basal level.
 The decreased serum calcium levels did not return to basal values.
 Biochemical parameters of bone formation, serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, showed a slight increase during the first month after stimulation of the parathyroids and a corresponding increase in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.
 These formation parameters decreased thereafter, probably representing coupling between bone resorption and bone formation.

 Surface electrical stimulation using the ScoliTron device was applied to 40 adolescent patients for treatment of idiopathic scoliosis.
 Adequate follow-up was available for 30 of these patients.
 The overall failure rate was 15 of 30 or 50%.
 Due to curve progression while using the ScoliTron, these patients either went on to a fusion (9 of 15) or were changed to a brace (6 of 15).
 The remaining 15 patients were considered successes with no curve progression (10 of 30 or 33%) or successful/failures with slight curve progression not requiring a change in treatment (5 of 30 or 17%).
 None of the various parameters analyzed were found to be useful indicators of successful treatment using the ScoliTron device.

 The osteoclast is known to be derived from the hemopoietic stem cell, but its lineage and the mechanisms by which its differentiation is regulated are largely unknown.
 There is evidence that osteoclastic differentiation is induced through a contact-dependent interaction between bone marrow stromal cells and hemopoietic precursors.
 To analyze osteoclastic lineage, colonies were generated in semi-solid medium from mouse spleen cells in the presence of erythropoietin with either Wehi 3B-conditioned medium or interleukin 3 (IL3).
 After 7 days, individual colonies were picked.
 Half of each colony was phenotyped by the morphology of cells in cytospin preparations; the second half of each was incubated for 7 days with a bone marrow-derived cell line (ts8) that induces osteoclastic differentiation from hemopoietic cells, on bone slices in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
 After incubation, bone resorption was assessed by scanning electron microscopy.
 No resorption was induced in cells derived from single-lineage colonies, but resorptive cells differentiated in 17% of granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colonies and 38% of multilineage colonies.
 Since only a minority of GM colonies contained osteoclastic precursors, this suggests that the GM colonies that contained osteoclasts were not typical GM colonies but may have been a form of multilineage colony analagous to other multilineage colonies that contain granulocytes, macrophages, and a third cell type.
 No resorptive cells were formed when IL3-derived colonies were incubated on bone slices without ts8 cells.
 The results suggest that osteoclasts are derived from a multilineage precursor, upon which IL3 acts to generate cells capable of osteoclastic differentiation, which form resorptive cells upon incubation with bone marrow stromal cells in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.

850,"Schwartz-Jampel syndrome with dominant inheritance.
 The Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS) is a rare congenital multisystem disorder of unknown pathogenesis which is characterized by distinct faces, skeletal deformities, joint contractures, short stature, muscle hypertrophy, clinical myotonia, and continuous muscle fiber activity.
 The inheritance pattern of SJS has been assumed to be autosomal recessive.
 We report the occurrence of the classic SJS syndrome in both a father and son in a non-consanguineous family, suggesting that SJS has the potential for a dominant pattern of inheritance.

885,"Microscopically assisted posterior lumbar interbody fusion.
 Microscopically assisted posterior lumbar interbody fusion was performed on 27 patients who had either spondylolisthesis or chronic lower back pain after previous lower back surgery.
 Overall improved satisfactory results occurred in 22 of 27 patients.
 Roentgenographic, stable, interbody fusion occurred in 22 of 27 patients.
 The poorest results and highest rate of pseudarthrosis occurred in patients with double-level fusions.
 Pseudarthrosis occurred in four of six patients with double-level fusions and unsatisfactory clinical results occurred in five of six patients with double-level fusions.
 Advantages of the microscopic technique are better examination of the surgical site, less blood loss, and less surgical dissection than other surgical salvage techniques.
 This procedure should be reserved for single-level pathology in the lumbosacral spine.

890,"Deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals in the ligamentum flavum: evaluation with MR imaging and CT.
 Four patients had spinal canal stenosis associated with deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate within the ligamentum flavum.
 Radiologic evaluation was performed with magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, and surgery was performed on all four patients.
 Pathologic examination of the surgical specimens demonstrated deposits of calcium pyrophosphate crystals within the ligamentum flavum.
 Focal enlargement of the ligamentum flavum was present in the cervical spine (n = 1), while a more diffuse, bilateral enlargement was identified in the lumbar spine (n = 3).
 Enlargement of the ligament either caused or was a component of spinal stenosis that caused neurologic signs or symptoms.
 Three of the patients had evidence of calcium pyrophosphate deposition elsewhere.
 Deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate within the ligamentum flavum causing either focal or diffuse enlargement can be associated with significant spinal stenosis.

894,"Bone resorption, stability, and soft-tissue changes following large chin advancements.
 Large advancement genioplasties were performed in 10 patients (mean advancement, 11.7 mm) by horizontal osteotomy of the inferior border of the mandible, with preservation of a musculoperiosteal pedicle to the advanced genial segment.
 Preoperative, immediate postoperative, and long-term follow-up lateral cephalometric radiographs were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the osseous and soft-tissue changes of the chin.
 After a mean follow-up period of 15 months, 76% of the initial advancement was preserved, representing 24% osseous resorption.
 The enveloping soft tissues of the chin followed the bony movement in a ratio of 1:0.88.
 Horizontal osteotomy of the inferior border of the mandible was a relatively stable procedure when used for large chin advancements.
 The broadcast possible musculoperiosteal pedicle should remain attached to the advanced genial segment to minimize osseous resorption and to achieve more predictable soft-tissue changes.

837,"The pathology of metabolic bone disease.
 The skeletal manifestations of the diverse group of metabolic bone diseases are mediated through the altered function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts and abnormal rates of mineralization.
 Appropriate understanding of their pathologic conditions requires familiarity with the normal anatomy and physiology of the skeleton.
 The accurate identification of metabolic bone disease frequently demands histologic confirmation and sophisticated analysis of undecalcified bone specimens labeled with tetracycline by histomorphometric techniques.
 These procedures allow the assessment of many morphologic features that characterize specific disease states.
 The most common types of metabolic bone diseases are acquired disorders; nonetheless, rare forms frequently are genetically based and cause intrinsic alterations in the bone-cell populations.

847,"Tests for posterolateral instability of the knee in normal subjects. Results of examination under anesthesia.
 An apparently normal knee was examined in each of 100 subjects while they were under general or epidural anesthesia for an unrelated operation.
 The Lachman, anterior drawer, posterior drawer, and pivot-shift tests were negative in all knees.
 All knees were stable to varus and valgus stress at both 0 and 30 degrees of flexion.
 The external-rotation recurvatum test also was negative in all knees.
 A positive reversed pivot-shift sign was present in 35 per cent of the knees, suggesting that it may not signify abnormality, at least not without a negative test on the contralateral knee.
 The results of the posterolateral drawer test were variable, difficult to quantify, and did not always have a firm end-point.
 The amount of maximum external rotation of the tibia, measured from the reference line of the medial border of the foot, was extremely variable at both 30 and 90 degrees of flexion of the knee.
 External rotation, as determined by this reference, was slightly greater (averaging 9 degrees) at 90 than at 30 degrees of flexion.
 The normal range of maximum external rotation of the foot was 10 to 45 degrees at 30 degrees of flexion of the knee and 15 to 70 degrees at 90 degrees of flexion.
 The presence of a large angle of external rotation and a positive reversed pivot-shift sign correlated strongly with increased ligamentous laxity and mild varus alignment of the knee.

940,"Clinical features of misdiagnosed appendicitis in children.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical features of children with misdiagnosed appendicitis with those of children with appendicitis initially diagnosed correctly.
 DESIGN: Retrospective review of hospital, emergency department, and clinic records.
 SETTING: University medical center with annual ED census of 40,000 patients.
 PARTICIPANTS: Children less than 13 years old admitted between May 1, 1979, and April 30, 1989, with a discharge diagnosis of appendicitis.
 MEASUREMENTS: Records were reviewed for historical, physical examination, laboratory, and pathologic features for all patients on their initial presentation to a physician and on final presentation during which the correct diagnosis was made.
 Using chi 2 analysis and Student's test, clinical features of misdiagnosed patients and patients diagnosed correctly were compared.
 RESULTS: One hundred eighty-one cases were identified with 50 initially misdiagnosed.
 On initial presentation, misdiagnosed patients were younger and more likely to have vomiting before pain onset, constipation, diarrhea, dysuria, and signs and symptoms of upper respiratory infections.
 Misdiagnosed cases were less likely to have right lower quadrant tenderness and documentation of bowel sounds, peritoneal signs, and rectal examinations.
 On final presentation, misdiagnosed patients were more likely to have pain duration of more than two days, temperature of more than 38.3 C, and to appear lethargic and irritable (P less than .05 for all measurements).
 CONCLUSION: Clinical features of children with misdiagnosed appendicitis differ from those of children with appendicitis initially diagnosed correctly.

966,"Isolated lipase and colipase deficiency in two brothers.
 Two brothers of Arab origin, aged 15 and 10 years, with isolated congenital lipase and colipase deficiency are described.
 Both were normally developed with a history of passing greasy stools since early infancy.
 Both have remarkable steatorrhoea and low serum carotene and vitamin E concentrations.
 After exocrine pancreatic stimulation, lipase and colipase activities in the duodenal fluid were almost completely absent, while amylase trypsin, bile salt, and pH values were normal.
 No other aetiology for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was found.
 This is the first report of congenital combined lipase and colipase deficiency in two brothers.

1061,"Enteroclysis and small bowel series: comparison of radiation dose and examination time.
 Respective radiation doses and total examination and fluoroscopy times were compared for 50 patients; 25 underwent enteroclysis and 25 underwent small bowel series with (n = 17) and without (n = 8) an examination of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
 For enteroclysis, the mean skin entry radiation dose (12.3 rad [123 mGy]) and mean fluoroscopy time (18.4 minutes) were almost 1 1/2 times greater than those for the small bowel series with examination of the upper GI tract (8.4 rad [84 mGy]; 11.4 minutes) and almost three times greater than those for the small bowel series without upper GI examination (4.6 rad [46 mGy]; 6.3 minutes).
 However, the mean total examination completion time for enteroclysis (31.2 minutes) was almost half that of the small bowel series without upper GI examination (57.5 minutes) and almost four times shorter than that of the small bowel series with upper GI examination (114 minutes).
 The higher radiation dose of enteroclysis should be considered along with the short examination time, the age and clinical condition of the patient, and the reported higher accuracy when deciding on the appropriate radiographic examination of the small bowel.

951,"Non-specific reactions in enzyme linked immunosorbent assays for serum antibody to entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia in non-endemic areas.
 Serum samples from 20 Indian children with diarrhoea were compared with those from 20 children resident in the United Kingdom who had been diagnosed as having ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's disease, or indeterminate colitis using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays specific for Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia.
 More than 50% of the United Kingdom patients had high IgG responses in ELISAs for E histolytica and G lamblia.
 A confirmatory ELISA showed that the British sera reacted specifically to bovine serum proteins rather than to protozoal antigens.
 Prior incubation of sera with 5% bovine serum prohibited this reaction.
 Bovine serum is an integral part of the crude soluble antigen used in most ELISAs for E histolytica and G lamblia and needs to be replaced with purified antigen preparations.
 The British sera also reacted to other commonly used blocking agents such as bovine serum albumin, casein, and normal sheep serum.
 These reactions were attributed to uptake of dietary antigens or an enhanced immunological response to these antigens in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

988,"Gallstone lithotripsy: relevant physical principles and technical issues.
 A basic understanding of shock wave generation is essential for the radiologist who performs gallstone lithotripsy.
 Shock waves differ from ordinary acoustic waves in that they have a rapid rise time, a positive pressure component that gives rise to compressive forces approaching 1,000 atm, and a low-amplitude sustained negative pressure (rarefactive) component.
 Shock waves are created by means of three different types of shock wave generators: spark-gap, electromagnetic, and piezoelectric.
 The authors describe and compare these three types of shock wave generators with regard to equipment selection.
 Regardless of how shock waves are generated, they share common interactions with tissue.
 These interactions are reviewed along with the proposed mechanisms of stone fragmentation.

937,"Evidence for the targeting by 2-oxo-dehydrogenase enzymes in the T cell response of primary biliary cirrhosis.
 Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune liver disease that includes the presence of lymphoid infiltrates in portal tracts, high titer autoantibodies against pyruvate dehydrogenase-E2 (PDH-E2) and branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase-E2 (BCKD-E2), and biliary tract destruction.
 The mechanism by which the autoimmune response is induced, the specificity of damage to the biliary epithelium, and the role of T cells in PBC are still unknown.
 To address these issues, we have taken advantage of a mouse mAb, coined C355.1, and studied its reactivity against a panel of liver tissue from normal subjects as well as a panel of liver specimens from patients with PBC, progressive sclerosing cholangitis, and chronic active hepatitis (CAH).
 C355.1, much like human autoantibodies to PDH-E2, reacts exclusively by immunoblotting with PDH-E2, binds to the inner lipoyl domain of the protein, and inhibits PDH-E2 activity in vitro.
 In addition, we have also attempted to develop cloned T cell lines that react with PDH-E2 and/or BCKD-E2 using liver biopsies from patients with PBC, compared with CAH.
 Although monoclonal C355.1 produced typical mitochondrial fluorescence on sections of normal liver, pancreas, lung, heart, thyroid, and kidney, it produced a distinct and intense reactivity when used to stain the bile ducts of patients with PBC.
 Nine of 13 PBC liver biopsies studied herein contained bile ducts on light microscopy, all of which reacted intensely at a 1:100 culture supernatant dilution of monoclonal C355.1.
 In contrast, although bile ducts of liver specimens from normals, CAH, and progressive sclerosing cholangitis also reacted with C355.1, such reactivity was exclusively mitochondrial and readily detectable only at a dilution of 1:2.
 More importantly, we generated CD4+, CD8-, alpha beta TCR+ cloned T cell lines from patients with PBC, but not from CAH, that produced IL-2 specifically in response to PDH-E2 or BCKD-E2.

1040,"Evidence for role of prostacyclin as a systemic hormone in portal hypertension.
 The possibility that prostacyclin could be a systemic hormone and could mediate the splanchnic hyperemia of chronic portal hypertension was evaluated in rabbits in a normotensive state and in rabbits with chronic partial ligation of the portal vein.
 In rabbits with portal hypertension (PHT), 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha, a prostacyclin degradation product) was elevated twofold in all vascular beds (systemic arterial, systemic venous, and portal venous) when compared with levels in control animals.
 In PHT rabbits, exogenous prostacyclin infusion after cyclooxygenase blockade through the systemic arterial, systemic venous, or portal venous route resulted in an equal elevation of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in the reciprocal vascular beds and restored the original precyclooxygenase blockade hemodynamics.
 These hemodynamic changes were of equal magnitude irrespective of site of infusion in PHT.
 In controls there was no significant change in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha or hemodynamics with intraportal infusion.
 We conclude that prostacyclin achieves systemic levels by escaping hepatic degradation resulting from portosystemic shunting in the animal with chronic portal hypertension.

1095,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
 With more than 500,000 cholecystectomies performed per year, great interest has developed in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
 The procedure offers the patient reduced hospital stay, faster return to work, less pain, and improved cosmetic results.
 In September 1988, we developed a technique of performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy that we have now performed in more than 800 cases with good results.
 The technique allows the surgeon to fully evaluate the common duct via operative cholangiography and has allowed us to use a laparoscopic approach in all patients who were candidates for cholecystectomy.
 The technique offers a minimally invasive alternative to open cholecystectomy.

1030,"Twelve hour overnight oesophageal pH monitoring in patients with reflux symptoms.
 Results of continuous 12 hour overnight pH monitoring (duration of pH less than 4) were reviewed in 112 patients with heartburn or regurgitation, or both, and in 56 normal subjects.
 Patients had more reflux than normal subjects.
 Medically controlled patients (n = 51) had less acid reflux than patients who subsequently underwent reflux surgery (n = 61), but there was a considerable overlap between those two groups.
 Surgery was followed by a reduction in acid reflux to a value similar to that in normal subjects.
 Patients in whom surgery was deemed to have failed had more reflux after the operation than those in whom it was successful, but no difference could be found in the preoperative reflux values of these two subgroups.
 Monitoring pH is not of value in selecting candidates for surgery since the results are not a good predictor of outcome, but it is useful in the objective evaluation of surgical results.

1062,"Peptic ulcer disease: CT evaluation.
 The authors retrospectively describe the computed tomographic (CT) findings in 35 patients with peptic ulcer disease.
 Three of eight patients with gastritis or duodenitis had bowel-wall thickening.
 Ten of the remaining 27 patients had CT evidence of ulcer perforation (n = 2) or penetration (n = 8), four cases of which were unsuspected clinically.
 Both patients with acute free perforation had pneumoperitoneum, and one showed free extravasation of orally administered contrast material.
 The precise site of perforation could not be established in either case with CT.
 The eight patients with ulcer penetration had CT evidence of bowel-wall thickening (n = 3) and inflammatory changes in adjacent soft tissues and organs (n = 8), including the pancreas (n = 4), liver (n = 1), and lesser omentum (n = 1).
 Ulcer craters were seen in only two.
 The CT findings of penetration can mimic other disease processes.
 CT was not useful in detecting uncomplicated peptic ulcer disease.

945,"The epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease: a large, population-based study in Sweden.
 Previous population-based incidence studies of inflammatory bowel disease are limited by small numbers, short duration, or inadequate case-finding.
 To address these problems, we identified all persons with confirmed ulcerative colitis (n = 2509) or Crohn's disease (n = 1469) in the Uppsala Health Care Region from 1965 to 1983.
 Age-specific incidence rates by sex were slightly greater for males with ulcerative colitis and females with Crohn's disease.
 Incidence rates for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease were higher in urban than rural areas.
 The annual incidence rate of ulcerative colitis increased from less than 7 per 100,000 to more than 12 per 100,000 during the study period, while the rate for Crohn's disease remained between 5 and 7 per 100,000.
 The increase in the incidence of ulcerative colitis was the result of a marked increase in the number of patients with ulcerative proctitis.
 Analyses by 5-year birth cohorts suggest that those born from 1945 through 1954 were at higher risk for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and that this effect was accounted for by those born in the first half of the year.
 The seasonality in the cohort effect, combined with the urban preponderance of disease, suggests that environmental causes may be involved in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

1071,"Ulcerative colitis disease activity as subjectively assessed by patient-completed questionnaires following orthotopic liver transplantation for sclerosing cholangitis.
 To assess whether or not liver transplantation and subsequent immunosuppression with cyclosporine and prednisone affect ulcerative colitis symptomatology, we surveyed by questionnaire all 23 surviving patients with pretransplant colonoscopy-documented ulcerative colitis who were transplanted for primary sclerosing cholangitis between June 1982 and September 1985.
 At follow-up [89.8 +/- 7.6 weeks (mean +/- SEM], all six patients who had had asymptomatic colonoscopy-documented ulcerative colitis reported continued ulcerative colitis quiescence.
 Among the 17 patients who had had symptomatic colonoscopy-documented ulcerative colitis at time of liver transplantation, 88.2% reported improvement in overall ulcerative colitis severity (P less than 0.001), with significant improvement in the frequency of bowel movements reported by 100%, in crampy abdominal pain by 87.5%, in bowel urgency by 75%, in the occurrence of pus or mucus in stool by 87.5%, in the incidence of ulcerative colitis flares by 81.8%, and in the number of days unable to function normally due to ulcerative colitis symptoms by 78.6% (all at least P less than 0.01).

 A case-control study was carried out in Stockholm, Sweden between 1984 and 1987 to evaluate the association of cigarette smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke during childhood and the subsequent development of inflammatory bowel disease.
 Information on smoking was obtained by a postal questionnaire.
 The relative risk of Crohn's disease in current smokers compared with those who had never smoked was 1.33 (95% confidence limits 0.7; 2.6) in men and 4.99 (2.7; 9.2) in women; the corresponding results for ulcerative colitis were 0.96 (0.5; 1.8) and 0.72 (0.4; 1.4).

1039,"Self-management of dietary compliance in coeliac disease by means of ELISA ""home test"" to detect gluten.
 To improve compliance with a gluten-free diet in coeliac disease a simple prototype test kit was developed to detect gluten in foods for use at home.
 The test is based on monoclonal antibodies to heat-stable gluten proteins which crossreact appropriately with barley and rye proteins.
 It is suitable for use with a wide range of raw or cooked foods.
 The food is extracted with dilute hydrochloric acid and 1 drop of the extract transferred to an antibody-coated tube; enzyme-labelled gluten detection antibody is added and after 3 min the tube is washed and colour developer is added.
 The reaction is stopped after 2 min, stabilising the blue colour.
 The home kit was compared with a quantitative laboratory kit, and the qualitative agreement was very good.
 The kit could distinguish foods with trace gluten contents (acceptable for a ""gluten-free"" diet) from those with a slightly higher but unacceptable gluten content.
 In a trial of the prototype kit by 47 coeliac disease patients of diverse ages and educational backgrounds, 93% of tests correctly identified foods as acceptable or unacceptable.

936,"Isolation and characterization of cDNA encoding a human nuclear antigen predominantly recognized by autoantibodies from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.
 Autoantibodies to a novel nuclear Ag, Sp100, have recently been described that recognize a nuclear protein with an apparent molecular mass of 95 to 100 kDa and a dot-like distribution within cell nuclei.
 By immunoscreening of a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library derived from HeLa cells with an anti-Sp100 autoimmune serum a 0.7-kb cDNA (Sp26) coding for a fragment of Sp100 was isolated.
 Expression of this cDNA and use of the recombinant protein in ELISA revealed that the fragment carries major Sp100 autoepitopes and that anti-Sp100 autoantibodies predominantly occur in patients suffering from primary biliary cirrhosis (50/184).
 The Sp26 cDNA was used as hybridization probe for isolation of longer cDNA from human liver- and placenta-derived lambda gt10 cDNA libraries.
 Overlapping fragments were assembled to generate a full length cDNA coding for a protein with a molecular mass of 53 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.7.
 The Sp100 autoantigen expressed in vitro from this cDNA and authenticated by a capture immunoblot assay, comigrated in SDS-PAGE with the authentic HeLa autoantigen of 95 to 100 kDa and thus showed an aberrant electrophoretic mobility.
 Computer based protein sequence analysis of the Sp100 autoantigen revealed regions of striking sequence similarities to the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains of various human and non-human MHC class I Ag and to several transacting transcriptional regulatory proteins.

1032,"Dissociation between systemic and mucosal humoral immune responses in coeliac disease.
 We examined humoral immunity in coeliac disease as expressed in serum (systemic immunity), and in saliva, jejunal aspirate, and whole gut lavage fluid (mucosal immunity).
 The aims were to define features of the secretory immune response (IgA and IgM concentrations and antibody values to gliadin and other food proteins measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) in active disease and remission, and to establish whether secretions obtained by relatively non-invasive techniques (saliva and gut lavage fluid) can be used for indirect measurements of events in the jejunum.
 Serum, saliva, and jejunal aspirate from 26 adults with untreated coeliac disease, 22 treated patients, and 28 immunologically normal control subjects were studied, together with intestinal secretions obtained by gut lavage from 15 untreated and 19 treated patients with coeliac disease and 25 control subjects.
 Jejunal aspirate IgA and IgM and gut lavage fluid IgM concentrations were significantly raised in patients with untreated coeliac disease; the lavage fluid IgM concentration remained higher in patients with treated coeliac disease than in controls.
 Serum and salivary immunoglobulin concentrations were similar in the three groups.
 Patients with untreated coeliac disease had higher values of antibodies to gliadin compared with treated patients and control subjects in all body fluids tested; these were predominantly of IgA and IgG classes in serum, and of IgA and IgM classes in jejunal aspirate and gut lavage fluid.
 Values of salivary IgA antibodies to gliadin were significantly higher in untreated coeliacs, though antibody values were generally low, with a large overlap between coeliac disease patients and control subjects.

1034,"5-Aminosalicylic acid is a potent inhibitor of interleukin 1 beta production in organ culture of colonic biopsy specimens from patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
 Interleukin 1 beta in biopsy specimens from inflamed colonic mucosa of patients with active inflammatory bowel disease was studied.
 Compared with normal colonic mucosal biopsy specimens, a significantly greater amount of interleukin 1 beta was present in rectal mucosa before (median (range) 4.3 (2.0-11.8) v 119.2 (30.1-286.8) pg/mg; p less than 0.01) and produced during organ culture (39.1 (9.4-106.8) v 97.6 (28.2-991.6) pg/mg; p less than 0.01).
 Values of interleukin 1 beta after culture correlated with concentrations of thromboxane B2.
 Organ culture of inflamed biopsy specimens in the presence of 5 aminosalicylic acid and dexamethasone reduced the amount of interleukin 1 beta detected.
 At the doses studied, 5 aminosalicylic acid also reduced the amount of leukotriene B4 detected after culture.

1118,"Location of abnormalities in panoramic radiographs of edentulous patients.
 A series of 308 panoramic radiographs of edentulous patients was examined for the presence of pathoses to determine whether any predictive basis could be found for occurrence of abnormalities by sex, age, or location.
 Radiolucencies, radiopacities, and retained roots and teeth were recorded by size and by anterior or posterior location in edentulous jaws.
 Radiopacities were the most frequently found abnormality (18% of subjects), followed by retained roots (8%), radiolucencies (3%), and retained teeth (3%).
 No significant correlation was found by chi-square test between type or location of abnormality and sex of the patient.
 There was, however, a significant relationship between location and type of abnormality.
 Radiopaque and radiolucent lesions were more frequently found in the mandible, and unerupted teeth and retained roots were more frequently seen in the posterior maxilla.
 Selective radiographs to detect retained roots and unerupted teeth in the posterior maxilla may be most productive in terms of prosthodontic treatment outcome.
 Otherwise, this study finds no basis for selection of intraoral sites for specific intraoral radiographs of asymptomatic edentulous patients.

 Temporary restorative materials are an important component of endodontic therapy.
 They must both adequately seal the access preparation between visits and protect the obturated canal(s) from microleakage until a permanent restoration can be placed.
 The efficacy of Cavit and T.E.R.M.
 (a new light-cured composite product) was compared with the use of a carbon black coronal microleakage protocol.
 The teeth examined had previously received coronal restorations.
 After the teeth were accessed, restored with Cavit or T.E.R.M., and exposed to the dye, they were cleared.
 Three-dimensional assessment then revealed that Cavit more consistently provided an effective seal.
 In addition, a great deal of microleakage was observed around the permanent restoration-tooth interface.
 This indicates that perhaps leaking permanent restorations should be removed in their entirety before initiation of endodontic treatment.

 Pulmonary embolism, although uncommon in children, occurs in as many as 104 per 100,000 pediatric patients.
 Undiagnosed and untreated pulmonary embolism has a high mortality rate; thus, a high index of clinical suspicion and reliable diagnostic modalities are necessary to ensure prompt and accurate diagnosis.
 We report the case of a patient with severe central pulmonary embolism with a normal ventilation-perfusion scan.
 The embolus was identified by a nuclear pulmonary flow study using dynamic imaging, which obviated the need for contrast pulmonary angiography.
 The traditional ventilation-perfusion scan may appear normal despite severe central pulmonary embolism.
 In this situation, early dynamic imaging is necessary to detect severe obstruction of the central pulmonary arteries.

 In isolated blood-perfused dog lungs, the capillary filtration coefficient (Kf) and the permeability-surface area product of urea (PS) were measured to determine their responses to two different methods of altering filtration area: lobe ligation (LL, n = 5) and glass bead embolization (GBE, n = 4) during constant perfusion rates (700 +/- 45 ml/min).
 When two of three lobes were ligated, Kf decreased (1.36 +/- 0.13 to 0.58 +/- 0.23 g.min-1.cmH2O-1; P less than 0.05), but PS did not change (2.02 +/- 0.4 to 1.71 +/- 0.3 ml/s).
 Kf per gram of perfused blood-free dry lung weight was unchanged by LL (0.051 +/- 0.17 to 0.052 +/- 0.18 g.min-1.cmH2O-1), indicating that surface area per gram measured by Kf remained the same.
 However, PS per gram dry lung doubled (0.07 +/- 0.016 to 0.146 +/- 0.06 ml/s; P less than 0.05) after LL, suggesting that recruitment occurred in the remaining lobe.
 When three lobes were embolized with 200-microns glass beads (0.48 +/- 0.01 g beads/kg body wt), PS decreased (2.1 +/- 0.22 to 0.94 +/- 0.09 ml/s; P less than 0.05), but Kf was not altered (1.01 +/- 0.17 to 1.04 +/- 0.18 g.min-1.cmH2O-1).
 The constancy of Kf after GBE implies that the vascular pressure increase during the Kf measurement was transmitted to both blocked and flowing vessels and thereby measured the same filtration area before and after GBE.
 PS decreased significantly after GBE because of a loss of perfused surface area by the beads blocking flow in small arterial vessels.

1247,"Pharmacokinetics of cefepime in patients with respiratory tract infections.
 The steady-state pharmacokinetics of cefepime were evaluated in 10 middle-aged and elderly patients with acute lower respiratory tract infections who were receiving 1 g intravenously every 12 h.
 One preinfusion and 15 postinfusion serum samples and total urine output were collected over one dosing interval between days 3 and 8 of therapy.
 Cefepime concentrations in serum over time exhibited a multicompartmental profile.
 Peak and trough concentrations in serum determined by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method were 71.2 +/- 17.2 (mean +/- standard deviation) and 6.0 +/- 4.9 mg/liter, respectively.
 The steady-state volume of distribution was 0.22 +/- 0.05 liter/kg.
 Elimination half-lives ranged from 1.93 to 6.04 h (3.92 +/- 1.28 h), and total body clearances ranged from 36.9 to 102 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (73.0 +/- 19.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2).
 The disposition of cefepime at steady state in patients was comparable to previous observations in healthy elderly volunteers.
 The predictive performance of regression equations derived from single-dose studies in volunteers relating creatinine clearance with total body and renal clearances of cefepime exhibited slight biases (mean predictive errors, -9.7 and 2.1 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively) and similar precisions.
 Predicted and observed total body clearances (63.3 +/- 25.1 versus 73.0 +/- 19.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively) and renal clearances (51.3 +/- 24.4 versus 49.3 +/- 19.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively) were not significantly different.
 The pharmacokinetics of cefepime in infected patients appeared to be unaltered by illness, and the steady-state disposition of cefepime was predictable from data derived from single-dose studies in volunteers.

1202,"Inhibition by methylprednisolone of leukocyte-induced pulmonary damage.
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The purpose of this study was twofold: the development of a chronic model of leukocyte-mediated pulmonary injury and the evaluation of the protective effects of methylprednisolone.
 Rabbits were inoculated ip with zymosan.
 Blood gases and circulating leukocytes were evaluated.
 Survivors were killed on day 10 for microscopic studies and for the evaluation of lung lipid peroxidation through the by-product malondialdehyde.
 RESULTS: Intraperitoneal zymosan resulted in a marked decrease of Pao2 and circulating leukocytes, and increased cellularity of alveolar septa, interstitial edema, and increased lung malondialdehyde.
 Pulmonary damage was partially prevented when methylprednisolone was administered before zymosan inoculation, but not when methylprednisolone was given 24 hr later.
 CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that a local nonseptic inflammatory stimulus may provoke remote changes to the lungs and that methylprednisolone may counteract the process only if it is administered before or very early after the onset of inflammation.

1238,"Interstitial lung disease: impact of postprocessing in digital storage phosphor imaging.
 The ability to resolve the fine linear structures of interstitial lung disease is one measure of the limiting performance characteristics of an imaging system.
 Conventional screen-film radiography was compared with six algorithms of isodose storage phosphor digital radiography (0.2-mm x 10-bit pixel matrix) in the detection of interstitial lung abnormality documented by means of computed tomography in 40 patients with abnormalities and 25 healthy control subjects.
 Performance was evaluated with an analysis of variance (the Fisher paired comparison test; P less than .05) of the average receiver operating characteristic area of 2,730 observations by six readers.
 The moderately and the more markedly high-frequency edge-enhanced algorithms of storage phosphor digital radiographs were equivalent in performance to screen-film radiography.
 The default mode, low- and medium-frequency edge-enhanced algorithms, and gray scale reversed mode of storage phosphor digital radiography were inferior to screen-film radiography.
 The authors conclude that high-frequency edge-enhanced algorithms can perform as well as screen-film radiography in the detection of interstitial disease.

1214,"Size distribution of human lung elastin-derived peptide antigens generated in vitro and in vivo.
 The protease-antiprotease hypothesis of emphysema development suggests that degradation of elastin in the lung interstitium may give rise to abnormal quantities of circulating elastin-derived peptides (EDP) during periods of inflammation.
 Recent studies have shown a relationship between emphysema and high levels of EDP in human plasma.
 This report characterizes elastin digests on the basis of antigenicity, size, and method of preparation, as well as the size distribution of EDP found in the plasmas of nonsmokers, smokers, and emphysema patients.
 Gel filtration of elastin digests prepared by hydrolysis of human lung elastin using a low (1:500) ratio of neutrophil elastase to elastin generated a broad protein peak of approximately 70,000 daltons.
 In contrast, a high (1:25) ratio of neutrophil elastase to human lung elastin gave a broad protein peak, with a size distribution in the 10,000 to 30,000 dalton range.
 This digest showed distinct immunochemical properties.
 A polyclonal antibody directed against the low-ratio digest showed a minimum detection of 2 ng/ml for the homologous antigen but required 1,000 ng/ml of the high-ratio digest for detectable inhibition in an indirect ELISA assay.
 Gel filtration of plasmas from normal nonsmokers and the majority of normal smokers revealed a single immunoreactive EDP fraction of approximately 70,000 daltons.
 Plasmas from selected normal smokers and emphysema patients with high levels of circulating EDP (greater than 90 ng/ml) fractionated into a complex pattern of peptides in which the 70,000 dalton component represented 50% of the immunoreactive material and several lower molecular weight peptides represented the remaining circulating elastin antigens.

1159,"Natural killer cell activity in a rat model of amiodarone-induced interstitial lung disease.
 The role of lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of amiodarone-induced lung disease is controversial.
 Increases in the percentages of lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar fluid of both patients and animals with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity have been reported.
 To assess whether these lymphocytes are functionally activated, we measured natural killer cell activity in the lungs and blood of rats with amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity.
 Amiodarone treated rats exhibited pathologic evidence of amiodarone-induced lung disease after one week of treatment and this injury was sustained and more extensive during the remainder of the study period.
 Control rats had histologically normal lungs.
 Blood NK activity was equally present in both amiodarone-treated and control groups and was not significantly different over the course of the study (16 +/- 3 percent and 13 +/- 2 percent, respectively; p greater than 0.05).
 Thus, NK cells were activated only in the lungs of rats treated with amiodarone, suggesting a local immune response in the lung.
 These data support the concept that lymphocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of amiodarone-induced lung disease.

 A modified posterolateral thoracotomy is described that combines the advantages of complete muscle sparing through a thoracolumbar fascial slide with excellent exposure.
 The technique is easy to perform.

 Experience with this approach in the first 49 patients suggests that it offers an attractive alternative to the standard muscle cutting posterolateral thoracotomy approach for elective procedures.

1160,"Fiberoptic bronchoscopy for refractory cough.
 Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) has a low yield in the diagnosis of chronic cough (greater than 3 weeks) in unselected patients.
 We assessed the yield of FB for cough during a four-year period in patients with nonlocalizing chest roentgenograms who were refractory to diagnostic efforts and empiric bronchodilator or antitussive therapy.
 Seven (28 percent) of 25 patients undergoing FB for cough (of greater than 1,500 bronchoscopies) had diagnostic findings (broncholithiasis, two; tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica, two; and tuberculous bronchostenosis, laryngeal dyskinesia, and arytenoid polyp, one each).
 No tracheobronchial neoplasms were detected.
 Age greater than 50 years and female sex independently predicted positive results (p = 0.02 Fisher's exact test), while duration of cough (two to 240 months), airflow, and smoking status did not.
 When patients with prior pulmonary or extrathoracic neoplasms were excluded, seven (35 percent) of 20 studies were diagnostic.
 Diagnoses potentially could have been made by thoracic computed tomographic scanning in four patients and indirect laryngoscopy in two.
 Fiberoptic bronchoscopy has a respectable yield for diagnosis of refractory chronic cough and is a reasonable procedure in carefully selected patients.

1271,"Improved technique for inserting a T tube in patients with subglottic stenosis.
 An improved method for inserting a silicone T tube through a tracheostomy stoma in patients with subglottic stenosis is presented.
 A silicone T tube is pulled into the trachea with a catheter that is inserted into the tracheostomy stoma, advanced through the stenotic subglottic space, and pulled out the mouth.
 A cone-shaped dilator is placed beforehand at the proximal end of the vertical limb of the T tube to facilitate the passage of that end through the stenotic subglottic space.
 This method was used in 4 patients with good results.
 We suggest this technique be tried when attempts to insert a T tube by the usual method fail, as it can be performed under local anesthesia without special instruments and is technically easy.

1287,"Argon laser stapedotomy.
 Lasers have been used in otology for 10 years.
 There have been reports of excellent hearing results using laser energy in surgery for otosclerosis.
 We used the argon laser in 75 consecutive primary stapedotomy procedures.
 The postoperative air-bone gap was 10 dB or less in 87% of patients and 20 dB or less in 95%.
 One ear (1.5%) had no postoperative hearing secondary to a granulomatous reaction.
 Complications were otherwise uncommon and mild.
 Most patients were treated on an outpatient basis.
 Our results compare favorably with other reports of laser surgery for otosclerosis.
 We conclude that excellent hearing results can be obtained using the argon laser for stapedotomy procedures.

1527,"The nature and course of olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease.
 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the specific nature and course of olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease.
 Previous studies had noted impaired odor identification, but there was no unanimity about the presence of odor detection deficits.
 METHOD: Odor identification was tested in 55 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 57 elderly control subjects by using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test.
 Odor detection was assessed in 46 subjects with Alzheimer's disease and 40 control subjects by using a forced-choice threshold test with geraniol as the odorant.
 RESULTS: Significant deficits in olfactory identification were present in subjects who were in the earliest stages of cognitive impairment, and these deficits increased as Alzheimer's disease progressed.
 There was some overlap in individual smell identification test scores between cognitively impaired patients and normal elderly subjects.
 On the other hand, odor detection deficits did not appear until Alzheimer's disease was relatively advanced.
 Smell identification test scores were correlated with Mini-Mental State scores, but geraniol detection was not.
 CONCLUSIONS: Odor identification is impaired early in Alzheimer's disease and may be more influenced by cognitive status than is acuity of odor detection, which is not altered until later in the disorder.
 The pattern of hyposmia in Alzheimer's disease suggests that the disorder may not ""begin in the nose,"" as has been theorized previously.
 Further refinement of olfactory testing may be useful in the diagnostic evaluation of early dementia.

1406,"Changes of hippocampal glucose utilization subsequent to amygdaloid-kindled generalized seizures.
 Local changes in cerebral glucose utilization during the postictal phase of amygdaloid-kindled generalized seizures were studied with the quantitative autoradiographic 2-[14C]deoxyglucose method in conscious rats.
 Measurement was initiated either just after termination of a behavioral seizure (GS-I) or 30 s after seizure termination (GS-II) to determine dynamic metabolic changes in the postictal phase.
 Although glucose utilization of the neocortex was remarkably depressed in both GS-I and GS-II, that of the hippocampus significantly increased in GS-I and then decreased in GS-II as compared with control.
 These changes of hippocampal glucose utilization were observed in all sectors of the pyramidal cell layer (CA 1-4) and in the molecular layer.
 Because metabolic changes associated with development of amygdaloid-kindled seizures begin in the limbic structures including the hippocampus, the transient increase in hippocampal glucose utilization observed in the early postictal phase indicates that the hippocampus is one of the key structures not only for initiating and maintaining but also for terminating kindled seizures.

1403,"Double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial of progabide as add-on therapy in epileptic patients.
 In a double-blind, cross-over trial, progabide (PGB) and placebo were compared as add-on therapy in 59 patients with moderate to severe epilepsy.
 Eight patients did not complete the study, 4 because of adverse drug reactions (elevation of liver transaminases, 2; gastritis, 1; and acute psychosis, 1) and 4 because of administrative reasons.
 Among the remaining 51 patients, seizure frequency was reduced greater than 50% in 18 patients with PGB treatment and in 8 patients with placebo (p less than 0.05).
 The number of days with seizures was significantly (p = 0.034) reduced during PGB treatment.
 Both patients' and physicians' preferences at the end of the trial were in favor (p less than 0.01) of PGB.
 Mild clinical side effects were present in 54.7% of the patients treated with PGB and in 37.7% with placebo.
 Increase in liver transaminases was observed in 2 patients during the double-blind study and in 1 during the follow-up period.
 Our data show that PGB, as previously reported, is useful in 30-40% of patients who are not responding completely to other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).
 The compound is well tolerated, but liver function must be monitored.

1332,"Brain potentials associated with movement in traumatic brain injury.
 Brain potentials may be used to assess the functional abnormalities that underlie impairments of movement.
 The purpose of this article is to illustrate the usefulness of examining these potentials.
 In addition to an overview of the topic, the article includes a report of a study demonstrating that there were differences between the brain potentials of five patients with traumatic brain injury and those of four healthy control subjects.
 All five patients were in the postacute phase of hemiplegia.
 Slow cortical potentials associated with simple goal-directed forearm and finger movements were recorded from frontal and parietal electrodes.
 Two seconds of movement-related electroencephalographic activity (movement-related potential) were recorded.
 The patients showed reduced brain potentials for movements associated with their paretic limb and, to a lesser extent, reduced brain potentials for movements associated with their nonparetic limb.
 The waveforms obtained from the patients were unusual, with uncharacteristic cross-cortical movement-related potential correlations associated with specific electrode configurations, as well as with specific movement conditions.
 Brain potentials associated with the fore-period interval of a simple reaction time paradigm were later recorded in two of the patients with traumatic brain injury and in a control subject to help determine the functional significance of the relative positivity apparent in their movement-related potential data.
 This preliminary study indicates that electroencephalographic potentials obtained during the preparation for and execution of movement can provide information regarding the basis for motor dysfunction.

1565,"Differences in the membrane interaction of scrapie amyloid precursor proteins in normal and scrapie- or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease-infected brains.
 The membrane interaction and hydrophobicity of the normal (PrPC) and infectious isoform (PrPSc/CJD) of scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease amyloid precursor proteins was studied.
 The normal isoform of hamster and human scrapie amyloid precursor protein was found on the microsomal/synaptosomal membranes anchored solely by the C-terminal glycolipid.
 Glycolipid cleavage resulted in dissociation from the membranes and change of behavior from a highly hydrophobic to a hydrophilic protein, susceptible to proteases.
 In contrast, the PrPSc/CJD isoform was resistant to release by glycolipid-cleaving enzymes.
 A part of PrPSc/CJD was released from the membranes after prolonged trypsin treatment, yielding a further protease-resistant product of 27-30 kDa.
 The results demonstrate the proteolytic resistance of the membrane-bound PrPSc/CJD isoform and also indicate the presence of a different, apparently disease-induced mechanism of membrane interaction in the scrapie- and CJD-infected microsomal and synaptosomal membranes.

1472,"Respiratory muscle strength and control of ventilation in patients with neuromuscular disease.
 To assess the relationship between respiratory mechanics and muscle strength and control of ventilation in patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD), we compared PImax and PEmax at RV, FRC and TLC, total respiratory elastance (Ers) with VT, TI, TT, VE, VT/TI, TI/TT, P.01, and P.01/(VT/TI) effective impedance in 21 patients with NMD and 21 healthy control (C) subjects, in seated position breathing room air.
 Ers in NMD patients was 79 percent higher than in the C subjects.
 While TI, TT, and VT in NMD were approximately half the corresponding C values, P.01 was 66 percent greater than in the C subjects (both p less than 0.001).
 NMD PImax and PEmax ranged from 37 to 52 percent of corresponding C values, respectively.
 Despite significant respiratory muscle weakness, only 7 of 16 patients demonstrated a PaCo2 greater than 45 mm Hg.
 Ventilatory output in NMD was modulated by respiratory mechanics as indicated by the increased P.01.
 In spite of muscle weakness, central drive in patients with NMD is not decreased, and in fact, is often increased.
 VE is not an accurate measure of central drive because of abnormal intrinsic respiratory mechanics and the effects of conscious responses or reflexes.

1469,"Single unit analysis of the human ventral thalamic nuclear group. Activity correlated with movement.
 During neurosurgical operations for the relief of movement disorders, single thalamic neurons (n = 107) were identified with activity which was related to verbally cued active movements (movement-related cells).
 The activity of each neuron was examined during different contralateral movements in order to determine the movement which was associated with the most consistent and pronounced change in firing rate (the optimal response).
 The optimal response was determined by analysis of histograms of neuronal activity which were constructed by using the onset of EMG activity to synchronize successive repetitions of the active movement.
 Movement-related cells exhibited optimal responses associated with such movements as making a fist, extension or flexion of the wrist, flexing or extending the elbow, pointing with the entire upper extremity, extending the tongue and lifting the leg.
 Most movement-related cells recorded in a single parasagittal plane in an individual patient had optimal responses related to movements involving the same part of the body.
 Movement-related cells were classified into those that were activated in response to somatosensory stimulation (combined cells, n = 20) and those which were not (voluntary cells, n = 87).
 Combined cells were activated in advance of EMG activity during active movement and so could be distinguished from cells responding only to sensory stimulation (sensory cells).
 Movement-related cells (combined and voluntary cell types) were located anterior to sensory cells and tended to show a mediolateral somatotopic organization parallel to that of sensory cells with cutaneous receptive fields.
 Combined cells responded to somatosensory stimulation of the same part of the body as that involved in the active movement related to the optimal response of the cell.
 Combined cells responding to passive movements of a joint always had their optimal response during active movement about the same joint.
 The activity of combined cells during parkinsonian tremor may clarify the role of sensory feedback in tremor.

1629,"Murine retroviral neurovirulence correlates with an enhanced ability ofvirus to infect selectively, replicate in, and activate resident microglial cells [published erratum appears in Am J Pathol 1991 May;138(5):1058]
 To determine the biologic basis of ts1 MoMuLV neurovirulence in vivo, newborn CFW/D mice were inoculated with neurovirulent ts1 MoMuLV and nonneurovirulent wt MoMuLV and the temporal response to virus infection in the central nervous system (CNS), spleen, and thymus was studied comparatively.
 Experimental procedures included single and double labeling in situ immunohistochemistry with selective morphometric analyses, and steady state immunoblotting of viral proteins.
 Cellular targets for virus infection were identical for both ts1 and wt MoMuLV and consisted sequentially of 1) splenic megakaryocytes, 2) splenic and thymic lymphocytes, 3) CNS capillary endothelial cells, and 4) CNS pericytes and microglia.
 Resident microglial cells served as the major reservor and amplifier of virus infection in the CNS of ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice; a similar but much less significant role was played by microglia in wt MoMuLV-infected mice.
 The genesis and progression of severe spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice were both temporally and spatially correlated with amplified virus infection of microglia, and hyperplasia and hypertrophy of both virus-infected and nonvirus-infected microglial cells.
 Direct virus infection of neurons was never observed.
 The development of clinical neurologic disease and spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice correlated with the accumulation of both viral gag and env gene products in the CNS; there was no selective accumulation of env precursor polyprotein Pr80env.
 When compared to wt MoMuLV-infected mice, the neurovirulence of ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice occurred by an enhanced ability to replicate in the CNS and to infect and activate more microglia, rather than by a fundamental change in cellular tropism or topography of virus infection.

 Using the presence of widespread cortical Lewy bodies (LB) as the pathologic criteria of diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), we describe serial neurologic and mental status examinations in 6 patients with DLBD, 3 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 1 patient with Parkinson's disease (PD).
 The 6 patients with DLBD included 3 with neocortical neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) consistent with coincident AD.
 Most patients with DLBD had gait impairment concurrent with mild to moderate dementia.
 Abnormalities of tone or resting tremor were also prominent early symptoms in the subjects with DLBD, but not AD.
 Patients with DLBD frequently had abnormal EEGs with background posterior slowing and a frontally dominant burst pattern at the time of mild to moderate dementia.
 Agitation, hallucinations, and delusions were frequent early symptoms in DLBD patients.
 Patients with DLBD without concomitant AD had numerous Alz-50 negative cortical plaques.
 Patients with DLBD have a distinct clinical syndrome that can be differentiated from AD.
 Pathologic features, including the absence of Alz-50 immunoreactivity, also differentiate DLBD from AD.

1414,"Effects of lactulose and lactitol on protein digestion and metabolism in conventional and germ free animal models: relevance of the results to their use in the treatment of portosystemic encephalopathy.
 Protein digestion and metabolism have been studied in laboratory rats and miniature pigs to investigate the mechanisms of action of lactulose and lactitol when used in the treatment of patients with portosystemic encephalopathy.
 Lactulose (beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-beta-D-fructofuranose) and lactitol (beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-D-glucitol) increased the excretion of nitrogenous material in the faeces and decreased nitrogen excretion in the urine in a similar degree to that reported for human patients.
 In studies with germ free rats given lactulose no such effect was observed, suggesting that, for lactulose at least, these effects are mediated by the gut flora.
 Measurement of the alpha-, epsilon-diaminopimelic acid content of the faeces confirmed that the enhancement of faecal nitrogen was due to an increased contribution from bacteria.
 The similarity in the results for lactulose and lactitol suggests that, from the perspective of protein metabolism, lactitol acts in a similar way to lactulose in the treatment of portosystemic encephalopathy.

 There are basic principles and techniques of measurement that are relevant across biomedical disciplines.
 The purpose of this article is to explain some of the most important of these for medical rehabilitation, to illustrate how to use them to choose assessment instruments and to describe the nature of measurement in medical rehabilitation by examples in brain injury rehabilitation.
 Reliability is basic to any scientific measure.
 Validity, the ultimate criterion, is closely associated with the purpose of the measure.
 Content validity, criterion validity and construct validity are explained.
 Sensitivity to rehabilitative interventions and significance in patients' real lives (ecological validity) are emphasized.
 Measures of functional outcomes (disability) may show improvement after rehabilitation even when impairment measures do not.
 An extensive but selected list of measures of coma, global status, disabilities, communicative and cognitive impairments, and handicaps is presented, and their main uses are illustrated.
 Examples illustrate how to choose measures to study comprehensive program-level outcomes, to study learning-based interventions and to develop a general purpose database.
 Although there are many measures of activities of daily living and mobility, little published evidence of reliability and validity could be found even for some well-known scales.
 Ecologically valid and sensitive outcome measures are especially needed.
 Studies of the clinical utility of measures were also scarce.
 Many of these gaps can be spanned by clinical researchers with limited resources.
 Physical medicine and rehabilitation will benefit from formal studies of the reliabilities and validities of both its old and its new measurement instruments and by increased sophistication in choice of measures.

1399,"Effects of discontinuation of phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate on concomitant antiepileptic medication.
 We report a prospective, controlled study of the effects of the reduction and discontinuation of phenytoin (PHT) (22 patients), carbamazepine (CBZ) (23 patients), and valproate (VPA) (25 patients) with concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).
 The principal changes in the serum concentrations of concomitant AEDs were (a) phenobarbital (PB) concentrations decreased by a mean of 30% on discontinuation of PHT; (b) total CBZ concentrations increased by a mean of 48% and free CBZ concentrations increased by a mean of 30% on discontinuation of PHT, with no change in CBZ-10, 11-epoxide (CBZ-E) concentrations; (c) VPA concentrations increased by a mean of 19% on discontinuation of PHT; (d) VPA concentrations increased by a mean of 42% on discontinuation of CBZ; (e) ethosuximide (ESM) concentrations increased by a mean of 48% on discontinuation of CBZ; (f) PHT concentrations decreased by a mean of 26% on discontinuation of CBZ; (g) PHT free fraction decreased from a mean of 0.11 to 0.07 on discontinuation of VPA; and (h) the mean concentrations of total and free CBZ increased by a mean of 10 and 16%, respectively, on VPA discontinuation, with a concomitant mean 24% decrease in total CBZ-E and a 22% decrease in free CBZ-E.
 Apart from the decrease in PB concentrations on PHT discontinuation, all significant changes had occurred by 1 week after the end of AED discontinuation.
 The implication for clinical practice is that a serum AED concentration at this time reflects the new steady state.
 Free concentrations did not add any clinically useful information to that gained from analysis of total serum concentrations.

1442,"Marked cerebrospinal fluid void: indicator of successful shunt in patients with suspected normal-pressure hydrocephalus.
 The authors blindly reviewed the charts of 20 patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus (a disease of unknown cause characterized radiologically as chronic communicating hydrocephalus and clinically by gait apraxia, dementia, and incontinence) who had undergone creation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
 The initial clinical response to surgery was graded excellent, good, fair, or poor; 5-year follow-up was available in 55% of cases.
 The magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained in these patients were also blindly reviewed for the magnitude of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow void (graded on the basis of extent rather than degree of signal loss) in the cerebral aqueduct.
 A significant (P less than .003) correlation existed between good or excellent response to surgery and an increased CSF flow void.
 The presence of associated deep white matter infarction on MR images did not correlate with a poor response to surgery.
 On the basis of these findings, it is suggested that patients who fulfill the clinical criteria of NPH and have an increased CSF flow void undergo creation of a shunt.

 Among five conventional surface montages, ipsilateral ear referential montage (IERM) showed a significantly higher number of BETS per unit of time than did any other surface montage used in the study.
 Thirty-nine records (50%) were performed after sleep deprivation (SD).
 When only IERM was considered, SD records showed a significantly higher number of BETS per unit of time (7.36 +/- 1.1) than did non-SD records (3.89 +/- 0.69) (p less than 0.01).
 Our findings support the general consensus that individual BETS may be normal variants, but a high occurrence of BETS in the record should raise suspicion of underlying epilepsy.

1437,"Noninvasive cerebral optical spectroscopy for monitoring cerebral oxygen delivery and hemodynamics.
 OBJECTIVE: To present an algorithm for noninvasive measurement of cerebral oxygen saturation (cerebral oximetry) and cerebral hemodynamics with near infrared spectroscopy.
 DESIGN: In vitro correlation of oximetry measurements with reference measurements; illustrative cases of hemodynamic and oximetric recordings.
 SETTING: Tertiary care neuroscience ICU.
 PATIENTS: Brain-injured patients with a prolonged, decreased level of consciousness chosen as illustrative examples.
 INTERVENTIONS: Two-channel multiple wavelength diffuse infrared transmission spectroscopy was interfaced with the scalp using adhesive.
 Transmission data were collected with gross superficial-to-deep spatial resolution.
 Saturation calculation based on the deep signal was observed longitudinally in the patient.
 With the same technology, arterial input and cerebral response functions, generated by iv tracer bolus, were deconvoluted to measure mean cerebral transit time.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A positive linear regression fit between diffuse transmission oximetry and measured blood oxygen saturation over the range 23% to 99% (r2 = .98, p less than .001) was noted.
 CONCLUSIONS: The approach used overcomes previously identified difficulties with cerebral oximetry, and demonstrates excellent in vitro correlation.
 The technique can be performed clinically without difficulty.
 A simultaneous measure of mean cortical transit time is possible.

1447,"Cerebral palsy: why we must plan for survival.
 The survival of children in the South East Thames region, born between 1970 and 1979 and diagnosed as having some form of cerebral palsy was investigated.
 Of the 732 children studied, 651 (90%) are still alive, and hence cerebral palsy must be regarded as a condition with which people live rather than a condition of which they die.
 Survival varies considerably among the different diagnostic groups: those suffering from spasic quadriplegia, dyskinetic and 'mixed' cerebral palsy are most severely affected.
 Our evidence suggests that, though immobility and severe mental subnormality are the strongest predictors of mortality in children with cerebral palsy, the majority of even the most severely affected patients survive to adulthood.
 It is therefore appropriate to plan for their survival by funding and evaluating programmes to maximise health, independence, and quality of life.

1299,"Stereotactic investigation of limbic epilepsy using a multimodal image analysis system. Technical note.
 A methodology has been developed for stereotactic investigation of limbic epilepsy using an image-analysis system that simultaneously displays different structural and functional images of the brain.
 The validity and accuracy of this system were established with phantom studies.
 Surgical planning and electrode implantation are guided by stereotactic magnetic resonance imaging, digital subtraction angiography, and position emission tomography.
 This methodology provides the spatiotemporal relationship of cerebral structure and function necessary to identify seizure onset and propagation in human limbic system epilepsy.

1493,"Telephone use to elicit voice or speech in brain injured subjects.
 The initiation of speech is often delayed in the early stages of recovery from a serious brain injury.
 We have found a high percentage of patients with both speech and swallowing problems.
 This makes bedside assessment of swallowing safety difficult because one cannot listen for the sound of aspirated material on the vocal cords when a patient is at high risk for silent aspiration and is often unable to cooperate with a videofluoroscopic study.
 The use of the telephone has been described several times for aphasia treatment, but not to elicit speech or assess swallowing safety early after brain injury.
 This study, therefore, recruited subjects who had brain injuries and (1) were referred early for swallowing and other evaluations, (2) were out of coma and able to follow some commands, and (3) did not initiate voice or speak when asked to.
 Subjects were asked three questions under two different conditions: face to face and after ringing the telephone from another room.
 The results were recorded on videotape and analyzed by another investigator for quantifiable differences.
 Six of the seven subjects responded better with the telephone stimulus than without.
 This technique may elicit voice or speech early after brain injury in some patients and may be useful in bedside assessment of swallowing safety.
 It may also serve as an example of appropriate stimulation of brain injured subjects coming out of coma.

1345,"Headache. Public health problem.
 Headache is, and apparently always has been, a frequent pain syndrome.
 It is reported in American and Western European societies in very high percentages of the population.
 Headache, and specifically severe headache, have also been reported as prevalent from a variety of societies worldwide, although prevalence rates have varied (they are very low, for example, in the People's Republic of China).
 Whether prevalence varies with different socioeconomic groups remains uncertain.
 Severe headache and specifically migraine is, for reasons still unknown, much more common in women, and, in most studies, is reported to decrease in prevalence in older age groups.
 Positive family histories are common, but the precise role of genetics is unknown.
 A major problem in the epidemiologic studies remains the difficulty of uniform definition of headache syndromes.

1593,"Detecting lower motor neuron dysfunction of the pharynx and larynx with electromyography.
 This study assessed the utility of clinical electromyography (EMG) for detecting lower motor neuron (LMN) or upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction affecting the intrinsic muscles of the larynx and pharynx.
 Twenty-nine subjects were examined; their clinical diagnoses included perioperative nerve injury, cerebral infarction, and lateral medullary infarction.
 Resting activity, motor unit action potential (MUAP) morphology, and MUAP recruitment were evaluated in every case.
 Medical records (excluding EMG data) were analyzed for clinical evidence of LMN or UMN dysfunction in the intrinsic muscles of the larynx and pharynx.
 The diagnosis of LMN dysfunction rested on clinical data consistent with cranial nerve injury, poliomyelitis, Wallenberg syndrome, or unilateral bulbar palsy.
 Criteria for UMN dysfunction included previous cerebral (not brainstem) infarction or mass lesion or the presence of hemiparesis.
 Electromyographic abnormalities were significantly associated with LMN dysfunction (p less than .05), but they were not significantly associated with UMN dysfunction.
 Of the parameters tested, MUAP recruitment was the most sensitive (82%) and specific (92%).

1435,"Cognitive and behavioural impairment among elderly people in institutions providing different levels of care.
 OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence and degree of cognitive and behavioural impairment in elderly patients in institutions providing different levels of care.
 DESIGN: Prevalence study.
 SETTING: A nursing home, a home for the aged and psychogeriatric wards in a provincial psychiatric hospital.
 PATIENTS: Only subjects 65 years of age or older were eligible for inclusion.
 A random sample was selected comprising 25% of the residents in the nursing home and the home for the aged; of the 119 asked to participate 95 agreed (44 in the nursing home and 51 in the home for the aged).
 All 50 on the psychogeriatric wards agreed to participate.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Kingston Dementia Rating Scale (KDRS).
 RESULTS: An MMSE score of less than 24 (cognitive impairment) was given to 37 (84%) of the residents in the nursing home, 43 (84%) of those in the home for the aged and 48 (96%) of the patients in the psychiatric hospital; the corresponding numbers for a KDRS score of more than 0 (cognitive impairment) were 41 (93%), 48 (94%) and 50 (100%).
 The seven patients receiving the highest level of care at the home for the aged (special care) had more behavioural problems than those in the psychiatric hospital did (p less than 0.001).
 CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive and behavioural impairment was widespread in the three institutions regardless of the level of care.
 When planning services and allocating resources government funding agencies should consider the degree and prevalence of such impairment among elderly people in institutions.

1380,"Neurotoxic action of veratridine in rat brain neuronal cultures: mechanism of neuroprotection by Ca++ antagonists nonselective for slow Ca++ channels.
 The effect of various Ca++ antagonists and local anesthetics on neuronal cell degeneration induced by veratridine was studied in primary rat brain neuronal cultures.
 Cell death was quantified by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released in the culture medium.
 The neuronal cell degeneration was Ca+(+)-dependent because, in the absence of extracellular Ca++, 16 hr of exposure to 30 microM veratridine failed to produce release of LDH.
 Ca++ antagonists, nonselective for slow Ca++ channels (flunarizine, cinnarizine, lidoflazine, prenylamine and bepridil) inhibited veratridine-induced release of LDH with IC50 values between 0.11 and 0.47 microM.
 Ca++ antagonists selective for slow Ca++ channels were less potent and inhibited veratridine-induced release of LDH at concentrations in the following order of potency: nicardipine greater than gallopamil and verapamil greater than niludipine greater than nitrendipine greater than nifedipine greater than nimodipine greater than diltiazem.
 Tested local anesthetics were incomplete inhibitors of veratridine-induced release of LDH.
 A good correlation was found between the potency of the drugs to inhibit released LDH induced by 30 microM veratridine in neuronal cultures and their binding affinity for the batrachotoxin binding site of Na+ channels in rat cortex synaptosomal preparation.
 It is concluded that protection against veratridine-induced neurotoxicity can be mediated by blocking a veratridine-sensitive Na+ channel.
 It is a property of certain nonselective Ca++ antagonists.
 There is apparently no direct relationship with Ca++ antagonistic activity.
 The effect is unrelated to local anesthetic activity.

1398,"Radiosurgery of acoustic neurinomas.
 Eighty-five patients with acoustic neurinomas underwent stereotactic radiosurgery with the gamma unit at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA) during its first 30 months of operation.
 Neuroimaging studies performed in 40 patients with more than 1 year follow-up showed that tumors were smaller in 22 (55%), unchanged in 17 (43%), and larger in one (2%).
 The 2-year actuarial rates for preservation of useful hearing and any hearing were 46% and 62%, respectively.
 Previously undetected neuropathies of the trigeminal (n = 12) and facial nerves (n = 14) occurred 1 week to 1 year after radiosurgery (median, 7 and 6 months, respectively), and improved at median intervals of 13 and 8 months, respectively, after onset.
 Hearing loss was significantly associated with increasing average tumor diameter (P = 0.04).
 No deterioration of any cranial nerve function has yet developed in seven patients with average tumor diameters less than 10 mm.
 Radiosurgery is an important treatment alternative for selected acoustic neurinoma patients.

1462,"Motor neuron disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is an insidiously developing, adult-onset, progressive anterior horn cell degeneration with associated degeneration of descending motor pathways.
 It has been recognized as an important clinical syndrome since the middle of the 19th century.
 Despite increasing clinical and research interest in this condition, its cause remains obscure, even in the broadest terms.
 Epidemiologic characteristics of the disease have been interpreted as evidence of both genetic and environmental causes.
 A major change in the view of this disease is the widely developing perception that it is a disease of elderly persons more than of middle-aged adults as was previously taught.
 Etiologic hypotheses encompass a broad range of postulated pathophysiologic mechanisms, and we review these in detail.
 The clinical limits of the disease can now be better defined by using modern diagnostic techniques.
 Although interest in supportive symptomatic therapy is growing, no intervention has yet been shown to modify the biologically determined motor system degeneration.

 Tables are provided for estimation of the risk of open spina bifida in patients who have elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels but normal results on detailed anatomy ultrasonographic scan.
 Risks are provided for various prior population risks, for various levels of elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, and for various assumptions about the sensitivity of ultrasonographic examination.
 The formula used is based on sequential multiplication of odds with the use of Bayes' theorem, but an arbitrary reduction (to the power of 0.5) in the degree to which ultrasonographic information modifies the odds has been made to allow for the nonindependence of ultrasonography and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein tests.
 The wide range of resulting risks shows that the decision to offer amniocentesis after a negative scan should be individualized.

1467,"Experiential phenomena of temporal lobe epilepsy. Facts and hypotheses.
 Experiential phenomena that occur in temporal lobe seizures and can be reproduced by electrical stimulation of temporal lobe structures typically encompass perceptual, mnemonic and affective features, either in combination or in isolation, which commonly relate to the patient's individual past experience.
 These phenomena raise interesting questions concerning brain mechanisms involved in human psychophysiology.
 The anatomical substrates for the evocation of these phenomena are widely distributed within the temporal lobe and include temporal isocortex and limbic structures (amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus).
 Arguments are presented which indicate that experiential phenomena are positive expressions of temporal lobe and limbic function and do not result from its ictal paralysis.
 Recent concepts of parallel distributed processing (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986) and the importance of parallel distributed cortical networks for higher cognitive functions (Goldman-Rakic, 1988a, b) provide a theoretical framework on which a hypothesis explaining experiential phenomena can be based.
 In conformity with these concepts the hypothesis assumes that temporal lobe epileptic discharge or electrical stimulation of temporal lobe structures can induce the elaboration of patterns of excitation and inhibition in widely distributed neuronal networks, some of which are capable of forming a specific matrix representing the substrate of a given experience.
 Neuronal networks engaged in parallel distributed processing (1) have the capacity to recreate the totality of a given experience when only a fragment of the network is activated, and (2) they tolerate a great deal of degradation by random inactivation of its components or by interference through random noise without serious loss of information content.
 These features are compatible with the assumption that localized epileptic neuronal discharge or electrical stimulation involving some temporal lobe structures could create a matrix representing features of individual experience of the kind activated in the course of temporal lobe seizures.
 Such an experience could, up to a certain limit, resist the degrading influence of mounting noise which inevitably must attend seizure discharge.

 Thirteen patients with dilated intraorbital optic nerve sheaths with an expanded, patulous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space were studied with high-resolution computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
 Eleven patients had bilateral findings.
 Headache or visual complaints, or both, were present in all patients.
 Signs of optic nerve dysfunction were present in eight patients.
 Three patients had visual acuity worse than 20/200.
 Cerebrospinal fluid pressure was mildly elevated in two patients.
 Three patients underwent a surgical procedure; visual acuity improved in one.

1394,"Four chromosomal breakpoints and four new probes mark out a 10-cM region encompassing the fragile-X locus (FRAXA).
 We report the validation and use of a cell hybrid panel which allowed us a rapid physical localization of new DNA probes in the vicinity of the fragile-X locus (FRAXA).
 Seven regions are defined by this panel, two of which lie between DXS369 and DXS296, until now the closest genetic markers that flank FRAXA.
 Of those two interesting regions, one is just distal to DXS369 and defined by probe 2-71 (DXS476), which is not polymorphic.
 The next one contains probes St677 (DXS463) and 2-34 (DXS477), which are within 130 kb and both detect TaqI RFLPs.
 The combined informativeness of these two probes is 30%.
 We cloned from an irradiation-reduced hybrid line another new polymorphic probe, Do33 (DXS465; 42% heterozygosity).
 This probe maps to the DXS296 region, proximal to a chromosomal breakpoint that corresponds to the Hunter syndrome locus (IDS).
 The physical order is thus Cen-DXS369-DXS476-(DXS463,DXS477)-(DXS296, DXS465)-IDS-DXS304-tel.
 We performed a linkage analysis for five of these markers in both the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain families and in a large set of fragile-X families.
 This establishes that DXS296 is distal to FRAXA.
 The relative position of DXS463 and DXS477 with respect to FRAXA remains uncertain, but our results place them genetically halfway between DXS369 and DXS304.
 Thus the DXS463-DXS477 cluster defines presently either the closest proximal or the closest distal polymorphic marker with respect to FRAXA.
 The three new polymorphic probes described here have a combined heterozygosity of 60% and represent a major improvement for genetic analysis of fragile-X families, in particular for diagnostic applications.

1545,"Relationship between body and brain temperature in traumatically brain-injured rodents.
 Recent work has shown that mild to moderate levels of hypothermia may profoundly reduce the histological and biochemical sequelae of cerebral ischemic injury.
 In the present study, the authors examined the effect of fluid-percussion injury on brain temperature in anesthetized rats and the effect of anesthesia on brain temperature in uninjured rats.
 The relationship between the brain, rectal, and temporalis muscle temperatures during normothermia, hypothermia, and hyperthermia was studied following a moderate magnitude of fluid-percussion brain injury (2.10 to 2.25 atmospheres) in rats.
 The results showed that mean brain temperature in 10 anesthetized injured rats, in 21 anesthetized uninjured rats, and in 10 unanesthetized uninjured rats was a mean (+/- standard error of the mean) of 36.04 degrees +/- 0.20 degrees C, 36.30 degrees +/- 0.08 degrees C, and 37.95 degrees +/- 0.09 degrees C, respectively.
 There was no significant difference in temperature under general anesthesia between injured and uninjured rats (p greater than 0.05).
 In the absence of brain injury, mean brain temperature was significantly lower in anesthetized rats than in unanesthetized rats (p less than 0.001).
 In anesthetized brain-injured rats, temporalis muscle temperature correlated well with brain temperature over a 30 degrees to 40 degrees C range, even when brain temperature was rapidly changed during induction of hypothermia or hyperthermia (r = 0.9986, p less than 0.0001).
 In contrast, rectal temperature varied inconsistently from brain temperature.
 These observations indicated that: 1) brain injury itself does not influence brain temperature in this model; 2) anesthesia alone decreases brain temperature to levels producing cerebral protection in this model; and 3) external monitoring of temporalis muscle temperature can provide a reliable indirect measure of brain temperature in the course of experimental brain injury.
 The authors believe that it is essential to monitor or control brain temperature in studies of experimental brain injury.

1667,"Conjunctival retraction suture for fornix adjustable strabismus surgery.
 The fornix approach to strabismus surgery is advantageous because the incision is made under the eyelid, there is no need for conjunctival sutures, it is comfortable for the patient, and there is minimal postoperative scarring.
 The major disadvantage of the fornix approach for the adjustable suture technique has been poor exposure to the muscle-suture apparatus and poor postoperative knot exposure.
 We describe herein the use of a subconjunctival retraction suture for adjustable suture surgery with the fornix approach.
 This suture retracts the conjunctiva, exposing the adjustable muscle-suture apparatus while simultaneously fixating the globe.
 A novel way of tying the noose around the pole sutures and preventing noose slippage is also presented.
 This technique provides excellent exposure, fixation of the globe, and complete coverage of the knot with conjunctiva after adjustment.

 The authors successfully performed clinical transpupillary retinal photocoagulation in 30 eyes of 26 patients with retinal vascular disease using a gallium-aluminium-arsenide (GaAlAs) diode laser emitting at 805 nm.
 Retinal photocoagulation was performed at treatment powers of 300 to 1300 mW and exposure durations of 0.2 to 0.5 seconds with a 200-microns diameter treatment spot.
 Patients treated with both diode and argon green lasers required 4.5 +/- 1.8 times greater mean laser energy with diode compared with argon to create ophthalmoscopically similar lesions.
 Parallel experimental retinal photocoagulation in Chinchilla rabbits required 3.1 +/- 0.9 times more power to create ophthalmoscopically similar lesions with the diode laser than with the argon laser.
 Intraoperative subretinal hemorrhage occurred rarely in patients with an incidence of 4 (0.44%) of 9021 treatment spots.
 Patients complained of moderate-to-marked pain in 10 (43%) of 23 treatments initiated under topical anesthesia.

 Measurements were made centrally and peripherally at 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees, and 25 degrees off-axis at each of the four meridians 45 degrees, 135 degrees, 225 degrees, and 315 degrees.
 A sine wave grating of 1.9 cycles/degree, reversing at 1 Hz was used.

 Normal values were established to compare those from 41 eyes from patients with either primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) with minimal field loss detectable on a Humphrey perimeter, or raised IOP and/or disc changes but no field loss (OH).
 Those with POAG had normal central contrast sensitivity, but at 20 degrees and 25 degrees eccentricity the values were greater than 2 standard deviations above the normal mean.
 This was also the case for high risk OH, but not for low risk patients.
 All the high risk patients except one who had abnormal peripheral contrast sensitivity had possible field defects (threshold elevation at one or more points more than 5 but less than 10 dB above normal mean).
 Only one of those with normal peripheral contrast sensitivity had such 'suspect points'.

1697,"A functional vagotomy induced by unilateral forced right nostril breathing decreases intraocular pressure in open and closed angle glaucoma.
 There is evidence of the central regulation of intraocular pressure, and it has been suggested that vagal tone might be increased in glaucoma simplex.
 The nasal cycle, the simultaneous congestion-decongestion response in the nasal cavities, reflects the dynamic lateralisation of the autonomic nervous system.
 Since this lateralisation presents with sympathetic activity induced by left brain hemisphere stimulation and parasympathetic activity induced by right hemisphere stimulation, it was subsequently demonstrated that forced unilateral nostril breathing induces selective contralateral hemispheric stimulation as measured by relative increases in the electroencephalographic amplitude in the contralateral hemisphere as well as alternating lateralisation of plasma catecholamines.
 Using this functional vagotomy, we report that left hemispheric stimulation by 20 minutes of forced unilateral right nostril breathing led to a significant bilateral decrease of 4.6 mmHg (25%) in intraocular pressure in 46 patients with open and closed angle glaucoma.
 However, it significantly increased the IOP in three patients with neovascular, one with juvenile onset, and one with closed angle glaucoma.

 To investigate whether radiologists can objectively define a high-risk group for prostate cancer, the researchers measured gland volume and compared it with results of a screening blood test, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assay.
 A total of 768 men, aged 55-71 years, were self-referred to two prostate cancer screening programs using transrectal ultrasound (US) and digital rectal examination.
 In patients with no evidence of cancer, statistically significant increases in mean PSA values were noted with increasing gland volume ranges (P less than .05).
 PSA values in patients with cancer were more likely to exceed the volume-adjusted 95th percentile (mean + [1.65.standard deviation]) than those in patients with negative biopsy results (P less than .005).
 Patients with PSA values above the volume-adjusted 95th percentile have an estimated risk for prostate cancer up to nine times that of the general screening population.
 The researchers conclude that knowledge of transrectal US gland volume and prostate-specific antigen assay type are important objective variables for future prostate cancer screening programs.
 The volume-adjusted 95th percentiles presented may help guide cost-effective management of current early detection efforts.

1763,"L-lactate high-efficiency hemodialysis: hemodynamics, blood gas changes, potassium/phosphorus, and symptoms.
 Hemodynamic changes were measured during high-efficiency hemodialysis (HEHD) using three dialysis solutions: L-lactate (46 mM), bicarbonate (35 mM + 4 mM acetate), and acetate (39 mM).
 Cardiac output was determined by changes in thoracic electrical bioimpedance.
 Although there appeared to be subtle differences in hemodynamic response to L-lactate versus bicarbonate, the blood pressure, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance were affected less with either of these solutions than with acetate.
 In particular, neither L-lactate nor bicarbonate HEHD were associated with a change in cardiac output, whereas with acetate HEHD a marked (22%) increase in cardiac output was seen concurrently with a moderate fall in blood pressure and TPR.
 Both acetate and L-lactate HEHD were associated with hypoxemia, whereas with bicarbonate HEHD the PO2 did not change.
 With L-lactate HEHD, correction of pH and plasma HCO3 concentrations was delayed but these values were not significantly different from those obtained with bicarbonate HEHD by one hour after dialysis.
 Potassium removal was comparable with the three dialysis solutions.
 Phosphorus removal with L-lactate tended to be slightly less than with bicarbonate, but not less than with acetate.
 Our results suggest that L-lactate (46 mM) dialysis solution may be a suitable alternative to acetate for HEHD, being associated with a hemodynamic profile that is similar to that of bicarbonate and better than that of acetate.
 Our results further suggest that the hypoxemia associated with the use of acetate dialysis solution is not intrinsic to acetate, but is due either to a low dialysis solution PCO2 level or to accelerated consumption of oxygen during substrate metabolism.

1845,"Radical radiation treatment of invasive and locally advanced bladder carcinoma in elderly patients.
 A total of 146 patients with invasive or locally advanced carcinoma of the bladder (T2-T4) underwent radiation treatment.
 A significantly higher complete response rate was observed with doses equal to or above 55 Gy and with doses corresponding to cumulative radiation effect (CRE) values of 1700 radiation effect units (reu) or more.
 In multivariate analysis, decreasing time from the first diagnosis of bladder carcinoma to radiation treatment and 1 or more transurethral resections was associated with a significant increase in survival; increases in T category and sedimentation rate were negative prognostic factors.
 Although both radiation dose and CRE levels had a significant effect on survival in univariate analysis, an increase in CRE levels alone was associated with a significant increase in survival in multivariate analysis.
 However, the most important predictor of survival was whether the patient showed a complete local response or not.
 This study emphasises the importance of treating patients with an adequate radiation dose over a short period of time in order to achieve the maximum radiobiological effect and thereby increase the possibility of cure.

 A multicentre study (ten centres) in seven countries was done to assess the contraceptive efficacy of hormonally-induced azoospermia in 271 healthy fertile men.
 Each subject received 200 mg testosterone enanthate weekly by intramuscular injection.
 157 men (cumulative rate at 6 months 65%) became azoospermic in three consecutive semen samples.
 These men entered a 12-month efficacy phase during which continuing testosterone injections were the only form of contraception.
 There was 1 pregnancy during 1486 months of the efficacy phase (0.8 conceptions [95% confidence interval 0.02-4.5] per 100 person-years).
 Discontinuations from the study were mainly because azoospermia was not achieved within 6 months and because of dislike of the injection schedule.
 The mean time to become azoospermic was 120 days (SD 40); reappearance of spermatozoa was detected in 11 men and in no case led to discontinuation from the study or to pregnancy.
 After the testosterone injections had been stopped, the estimated median time from azoospermia to recovery (sperm concentration of at least 20 million/ml) was 3.7 months (3.6-3.9) and to the subject's mean baseline sperm concentration was 6.7 months (6.2-8.7).
 Hormonal regimens that induce azoospermia can provide highly effective, sustained, and reversible male contraception with minimum side-effects.

1783,"Efficacy of bladder training in older women with urinary incontinence.
 The efficacy of bladder training was evaluated in a randomized clinical trial involving 123 noninstitutionalized women 55 years and older with urinary incontinence.
 Subjects were urodynamically categorized as those with urethral sphincteric incompetence (N = 88) and those with detrusor instability with or without concomitant sphincteric incompetence (N = 35).
 Bladder training reduced the number of incontinent episodes by 57%; the effect was similar for both urodynamic diagnostic groups.
 The quantity of fluid loss was reduced by 54%.
 This was greater for patients with detrusor instability than for those without it.
 Diurnal and nocturnal voluntary micturitions were also reduced.
 The effect on nocturnal micturition, however, was not observed in subjects with unstable detrusor function.
 It is recommended that bladder training be considered as an initial step in treatment of women with urinary incontinence.
 Provided prior comprehensive clinical evaluation is done, it can be prescribed without the need for urodynamic characterization.

1862,"Treatment of pyelonephritis in an observation unit.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of managing patients with acute pyelonephritis as outpatients after initial treatment with IV antibiotics in an emergency department observation unit.
 DESIGN: Prospective and uncontrolled.
 SETTING: ED observation unit.
 TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Nonpregnant female patients 14 years old or older without immunocompromise or serious underlying disease and no evidence of septic shock.
 INTERVENTIONS: All patients received two IV doses of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at a 12-hour dosing interval and promethazine and acetaminophen as needed for nausea and fever, respectively.
 Baseline laboratory data, urinalysis, and urine and blood cultures were obtained.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were observed for signs of septic shock, nausea, vomiting, and the ability to tolerate an oral intake.
 At the end of the observation period, 43 of 44 patients were discharged on oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.
 One additional patient who was doing well clinically was recalled and admitted because of a positive blood culture.
 CONCLUSION: Patients with acute pyelonephritis, despite significant fever or nausea and vomiting, can be treated effectively as outpatients after a brief period of observation and IV antibiotics.

1830,"Castration plus nilutamide vs castration plus placebo in advanced prostate cancer. A review.
 Combination of antiandrogen treatment with surgical or medical castration should improve the efficacy of endocrine treatment of prostatic cancer by blocking the effects of adrenal androgens.
 A nonsteroidal antiandrogen, nilutamide, has shown promising results in preliminary open studies.
 In a short-term (29 days) comparison of nilutamide plus buserelin and buserelin plus placebo, nilutamide (300 mg/day), significantly reduced bone pain, and fewer patients experienced worsening pain than in the control group.
 The initial buserelin-induced increase in prostatic acid phosphatase was prevented by nilutamide, but there was a similar increase in testosterone and gonadotropin concentrations to that seen in the control group.
 Thus, nilutamide can prevent the tumor flare-up associated with the start of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) treatment, even though the endocrine responses are not affected.
 In three multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of castration and nilutamide involving 248 patients, the combination of nilutamide and castration decreased bone pain, improved performance status, and increased the number of patients with objective regression, compared with patients who were castrated but did not receive nilutamide.
 Nilutamide was generally well tolerated, though visual disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and alcohol intolerance were reported in patients receiving nilutamide.
 The results suggest that nilutamide improves the efficacy of castration in patients with prostatic cancer.
 Current studies are investigating the effects of this treatment on survival and the risk-benefit ratio.

1866,"Measurement of urinary lipopolysaccharide antibodies by ELISA as a screen for urinary tract infection.
 Five hundred and twenty two clinical urine specimens submitted for routine microbiological examination were tested in parallel by conventional microscopy and culture and for lipopolysaccharide antibodies by an enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) to assess the ELISA as a screen for urinary tract infection.
 When the ELISA alone was compared with routine methods the specificity sensitivity, and predictive value of positive and negative tests was 73.2%, 75.7%, 51.1% and 38.5%.
 For ELISA with microscopy the same variables were 71.1%, 82.2%, and 92.4% and 94.7%, respectively.
 The ELISA absorbency increased with increasing bacterial numbers, but results varied widely.
 Only 65.4% of urines which contained greater than or equal to 10(5) bacteria/ml were positive by ELISA; 36.8% of urines with less than 10(3) bacteria/ml were positive by ELISA; 100% of greater than or equal to 10(5) bacteria/ml cultures of Pseudomonas sp (n = 4), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), and Streptococcus faecalis (n = 2) were positive by ELISA but only 71.4% of Proteus sp (n = 7), 61.4% coliforms (n = 70), and 25% of coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 4).
 It is concluded that further development is required before the ELISA can be used for routine screening for urinary tract infection.

1750,"The effect of verapamil on the anti-tumour action of mitozantrone and doxorubicin against renal carcinoma cells in vitro.
 Ten renal carcinomas were established in culture and their sensitivity to mitozantrone +/- verapamil, as measured by (75Se) selenomethionine incorporation, was studied.
 The 5 tumours with spread beyond the kidney were those in which sensitivity to mitozantrone was enhanced by verapamil.
 With 4 of the 10 tumours and 1 further carcinoma, similar experiments were performed using doxorubicin.
 This drug was more active, its anti-tumour action being related to concentration.
 Verapamil was more effective in potentiation of doxorubicin and this action increased in proportion to the concentration of verapamil added.

1738,"Prevalence of advanced renal failure in Northern Ireland 
 OBJECTIVE--To determine the prevalence of advanced chronic renal failure in Northern Ireland as part of an assessment by the Renal Association of the level of service provision for treatment of such patients.
 DESIGN--Prospective notification of patients reaching a defined level of advanced chronic renal failure (serum creatinine concentration greater than or equal to 500 mumol/l or blood urea concentration greater than or equal to 25 mmol/l) within one year and follow up for at least three, and, at most, four years after notification.
 SETTING--Northern Ireland.
 PATIENTS--122 Patients with a serum creatinine or blood urea concentration higher than the defined level newly detected from 1 March 1985 to 28 February 1986.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Survival after notification.
 RESULTS--77 Patients of all ages/million population/year had advanced chronic renal failure compared with 67/million/year between the ages of 5 and 80 found in an earlier study of the same population.
 62% Of the patients were older than 50 years.
 Seventeen (14%) of the patients either required dialysis or died within one month of notification, 51 (42%) survived for at least three months, and 23 (19%) for one year or longer.
 Three patients, all of whom were attending a renal clinic, survived for periods of 43, 45, and 46 months respectively without renal replacement treatment.
 CONCLUSIONS--The increased number of new patients disclosed in this survey compared with the earlier survey is mainly owing to an increased number of older patients.
 Such patients often have disabilities other than renal failure, are less likely to be capable of self treatment, may develop complications more often and require more frequent hospital admissions, and may not be suitable for transplantation and consequently have considerable resource implications for the NHS.

1759,"Functional status and quality of life: predictors of early mortality among patients entering treatment for end stage renal disease.
 We investigated the association between functional status and quality of life in newly-entered dialysis patients and the subsequent risk of mortality.
 We enrolled the patients from 37 dialysis facilities in two southeastern states (n = 294).
 Functional status was assessed by the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) and quality of life by the Spitzer Quality of Life Index (SQLI).
 During a mean (SE) follow-up of 479.6 (109.4) days 49 patients (16.4%) of the cohort died.
 The mean KPS score (SE) for survivors was 7.31 (0.11) and for non-survivors was 5.89 (0.26), P less than 0.0001.
 The mean SQLI score (SE) for survivors was 6.74 (0.15) and non-survivors was 4.95 (0.28), P less than 0.0001.
 Strong gradients of the risk of mortality were found for both measurements.
 After controlling for other covariates including age, race, sex, primary cause of renal failure and the presence of comorbidity, both the KPS and SQLI scores were independently correlated with risk of mortality.
 We conclude that functional status and quality of life are strong independent risk factors for subsequent mortality in new dialysis patients.
 These are easily measured indicators which may serve to predict subsequent risk of mortality or adjust case-mix estimates for comparisons between dialysis populations.

1724,"The epidemiology and clinical aspects of the hemolytic uremic syndrome in Minnesota 
 BACKGROUND.
 The frequency of the hemolytic uremic syndrome, characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, is increasing.
 Although Escherichia coli serotype 0157:H7 has been implicated as a causative agent, more information is needed about the basic epidemiology and clinical aspects of this syndrome.
 METHODS.
 We conducted a retrospective population-based study of hemolytic uremic syndrome in Minnesota residents less than 18 years of age from 1979 through 1988 to assess trends in disease occurrence, describe the clinical illness, and identify predictors of disease severity and outcome.
 We also conducted a case-control study of patients with onsets of illness from 1986 through 1988 to examine risk factors.
 RESULTS.
 One hundred seventeen patients were identified.
 The mean annual incidence increased from 0.5 case per 100,000 child-years among children less than 18 in 1979 (6 cases) to 2.0 cases per 100,000 in 1988 (26 cases) (P = 0.000004).
 E.
 coli 0157:H7 was isolated from 13 of 28 patients (46 percent) who had stool specimens submitted for testing.
 For those who presented with typical hemolytic uremic syndrome, an elevated polymorphonuclear-leukocyte count on hospital admission, a shorter duration of prodrome, and the presence of bloody diarrhea were predictive of severe disease.
 In the case-control study, the patients were more likely to attend large daycare centers (more than 50 children) than were the controls (odds ratio, 10.2; P = 0.03), suggesting that day-care attendance may be a risk factor.
 On the basis of the population-attributable risk, however, this factor could account for no more than 16 percent of the cases.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 This study provides evidence for an increase in the incidence of hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is probably related to an increased incidence of E.
 coli 0157:H7 infections.
 Hemolytic uremic syndrome has become an important pediatric and public health problem.

1874,"Radio-contrast enhancement of urinary tract stones.
 Most urologists treating stone disease with any method (ESWL, PCL, URS) have encountered problems of poor stone visualization with fluoroscopy.
 This difficulty to localize urinary tract (UT) stones or fragments may result in incomplete stone extraction, prolonged surgery and increased risk of recurrence and post-operative complications.
 We have sought and found means to increase the radioopacity of mineral UT stones by a simple pre-operative perfusion technique.
 The capacity of radioopacification has first been demonstrated in in vitro incubations of fragments of human mineral stones with aqueous solutions of barium, of the lanthanides and of the two natural actinides.
 Most of the incubations led to considerable radio-contrast enhancement and heavy metal incorporation, measured by X-ray fluorescence analysis.
 Dogs with implanted human stone fragments were used as an in vivo model.
 The UT were perfused through a retrograde pyelic catheter with heavy metal salts solutions, the ensuing radioopacification of the implanted UT-stones was estimated by abdominal radiographies and the metal incorporation was measured on the retrieved stones.
 Considerable radioopacity enhancement together with heavy metal incorporation was observed for the following elements: Sr, Ba and the lanthanides Gd and Yb.
 The pathological evaluation of the urothelial linings from animals treated with lanthanide salt showed no toxic effects.

1885,"Small artery resistance increases during the development of renal hypertension.
 Vascular pressures were measured in the principal (A1) arteriole and in upstream small arteries of the rat cremaster muscle to investigate vascular resistance changes associated with one-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertension.
 Pressure measurements were made at a proximal and distal site of each vessel using a servonull micropipette system.
 Vessel diameters were measured using video microscopy.
 A1 arteriole and external spermatic artery diameters were both decreased after 2 and 4 weeks of hypertension.
 Mean arterial pressure was elevated after 2 weeks of hypertension (106 +/- 4 mm Hg versus 140 +/- 5 mm Hg).
 Likewise, vascular pressures were elevated at every site: pudicepigastric artery (36%), external spermatic artery (47%), and A1 arteriole (38%).
 The pressure drop along the external spermatic artery was increased (87%) after 2 weeks of hypertension.
 Mean arterial pressure was further elevated from 2-4 weeks of hypertension (105 +/- 4 mm Hg versus 162 +/- 7 mm Hg) but only the proximal pudic-epigastric artery pressure was further elevated during this time from 2 to 4 weeks (131 +/- 5 mm Hg versus 147 +/- 7 mm Hg) of hypertension development.
 This was associated with an increased pressure drop (87%) along the artery compared with the situation at 2 weeks.
 These data indicate that small arteries upstream from the microcirculation contribute significantly to the increase in vascular resistance during hypertension.
 In addition, these data indicate that the increases in small artery resistance do not develop uniformly throughout all vessel branches.

1925,"Inhibition of spontaneous uterine contractions during the last trimester in pregnant baboons by an oxytocin antagonist.
 The effect of a potent oxytocin antagonist, produced in our laboratories, on spontaneous uterine contractions in the pregnant baboon was examined.
 Three types of uterine contractions were studied: immediately after operation, during the nocturnal period, and near or at labor.
 Bolus intravenous injections of oxytocin antagonist were given and uterine activity was examined +/- 1 hour after the injection.
 The oxytocin antagonist caused a precipitate decrease (approximately 70%) in contractile force (mean amplitude x frequency) in the first 15 minutes after injection (p less than 0.05); this force diminished to approximately 90% at the end of 1 hour for both nocturnal and labor contractions.
 In contrast, uterine contractions immediately after operation were diminished by only 60% within 60 minutes after the oxytocin antagonist.
 These results indicate that the oxytocin antagonist is a potent inhibitor and suggest that oxytocin is a primary regulator of spontaneous nocturnal and labor uterine contractions in the pregnant baboon.

1962,"Changes in women's mental and physical health from pregnancy through six months postpartum.
 A longitudinal study was conducted to investigate changes in women's mental and physical health around the time of childbirth, and to determine whether health was related to length of maternity leave.
 Thirty-seven married, employed first-time mothers completed questionnaires during pregnancy, and again at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postpartum.
 Results showed that, from pregnancy to the 6th postpartum month, the number of days that mothers were ill because of infections steadily increased.
 In addition, depressive symptoms for new mothers rose from pregnancy to the 6th week postpartum, and declined thereafter.
 For women who did not return to work during the period of the study, a significant decline in depressive symptoms was observed from the prenatal period through the 6th postpartum month.
 These findings demonstrate significant changes in mental and physical health for this group of first-time mothers.

1957,"Low incidence of positive amnionic fluid cultures in preterm labor at 27-32 weeks in the absence of clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis.
 In order to determine the utility of amniocentesis for detecting subclinical chorioamnionitis in asymptomatic afebrile women in preterm labor with intact membranes, we enrolled 47 women between 27-32 weeks' gestation in a prospective study.
 After enrollment, 38 women fulfilled all clinical and laboratory criteria for the study; nine women were excluded because they had a leukocyte count exceeding 15,000/microL.
 None of the 38 asymptomatic afebrile women had a positive culture from the amnionic fluid for bacteria, fungi, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, or any viruses.
 Sepsis was not proved in any of the 38 infants delivered to these patients.
 There was a clear relationship between histologic evidence of chorioamnionitis and failure of tocolytic therapy.
 Fetal lung profiles were mature in 29% of the amnionic fluid samples from 30-32 weeks' gestation, but in none of the amnionic fluid samples before 30 weeks.
 Amniocentesis does not seem useful to detect chorioamnionitis in asymptomatic afebrile women with preterm labor and intact membranes at 27-32 weeks' gestation, and should be reserved for those cases in which information about fetal lung maturity would be helpful.

1942,"Forskolin and methotrexate induce an intermediate trophoblast phenotype in cultured human choriocarcinoma cells.
 The human placenta and its associated membranes are vital to the maintenance, nutrition, and protection of the developing fetus.
 During placental development some cytotrophoblasts give rise to the chorionic membrane whereas others fuse to form a differentiated syncytium of cells that are responsible for placental protein and steroid hormone production.
 The mechanisms involved in the differentiation of the trophoblasts are unknown; however, an intermediate stage with a characteristic phenotype has been documented in vivo.
 We have observed that chemically dissimilar xenobiotic agents induced BeWo choriocarcinoma cells to change their usual cytotrophoblastic phenotype and acquire morphologic and functional characteristics typical of intermediate trophoblast.
 Incubation of BeWo cell cultures in the presence of 1 mumol/L methotrexate for 48 hours stimulated human chorionic gonadotropin secretion (2.3-fold) and aromatase activity (4.9-fold).
 Morphologic findings associated with these hormonal changes, including increased nuclear size and cytoplasmic expansion, were also observed.
 With the use of a computer-interfaced image analyzer, planimetric morphometry of the nuclear area of the cells revealed a 1.8-fold increase after incubation with methotrexate.
 The effect of forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase, was also evaluated by means of this model of cytotrophoblast differentiation.
 The addition of 10 mumol/L forskolin to BeWo cultures also resulted in dramatic changes in trophoblast cell phenotype.
 Increases in human chorionic gonadotropin synthesis (7.3-fold), aromatase activity (13.5-fold), and nuclear area (3.0-fold) were induced over those of untreated cells.
 In addition, increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation (1.7-fold) were afforded by both treatments.
 These results suggest that biochemical and cytologic changes associated with human trophoblast differentiation can be induced in vitro via activation of the adenylyl cyclase pathway by forskolin and through unknown and apparently independent signals by methotrexate.

1937,"Comparison of two preparatory techniques for urine cytology.
 Two methods of preparation of urine for cytology were compared retrospectively.
 In method 1 cells in the urine were fixed after the preparation of the smear; in method 2 the cells were fixed before smear preparation.
 Urine cytology reports were correlated with subsequent histological analysis.
 The specificities of urine cytology using both methods were high (99%).
 The sensitivity using method 1 was 87%; using method 2 it was 65%.
 This difference was significant.
 The cell preparation technique therefore significantly changes the sensitivity of urine cytology.

1935,"Effects of ethanol on hexose uptake by cultured rat brain cells.
 The effects of ethanol on hexose uptake by glial cells was investigated using primary cultures prepared from term rat fetuses.
 Specific 3H 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) uptake was significantly reduced by a 4-hr exposure to ethanol at concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 mM, but not 200 or 300 mM.
 The inhibitory effect of 50 mM ethanol increased with the duration of exposure, with 2DG uptake inhibited by 36% after 18 hr.
 Astrocytes cultured from the brains of term fetuses of rats fed ethanol during pregnancy showed essentially the same 2DG uptake response to in vitro ethanol treatment.
 Kinetics of 2DG uptake showed a significant decrease of Vmax in the presence of ethanol.
 No interaction was found between ethanol and insulin, which stimulated 2DG uptake and protein content of the cultures.
 The data suggest that ethanol can modulate hexose uptake by astrocytes cultured from fetal rat brain.
 However, insulin actions on glial cells were not affected by ethanol.

 A potentially avoidable laparoscopy was followed by a laparotomy in 27% of cases (18/67), and at least 13 of those laparotomies were unnecessary.
 In addition, two false-positive diagnoses of EP were made at laparoscopy, resulting in the avoidable loss of part or all of a single remaining fallopian tube.

 If histopathologic diagnosis was the standard, clinical accuracies of the gynecologists were no better than chance (p = 0.43), suggesting an expectation bias for visual diagnosis.
 Laparoscopy had a sensitivity of 50% (12/24) and a specificity of 80% (40/50) for salpingitis if the standard was fimbrial histopathologic diagnosis (p = 0.01).

 Using a retrospective cohort design, we analyzed the effects of intrauterine diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure on various antepartum and intrapartum events.
 Gravidas exposed to DES had a higher likelihood of being delivered abdominally, undergoing manual removal of the placenta, and hemorrhaging in the postpartum period.
 The increased risk for these events remained after controlling for age, race, and parity.
 We also constructed labor curves in DES-exposed women by plotting cervical dilation against time.
 The curves were similar for nulliparous DES-exposed women and nulliparous controls, but DES-exposed parous women experienced prolonged labors.
 These findings suggest that, in addition to the well-known adverse effects of intrauterine DES exposure, the interaction between the uterus and placenta is altered in some DES-exposed patients.

 BACKGROUND.
 A reliable, noninvasive procedure to determine the location of accessory atrioventricular connections in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome would add an important diagnostic tool to the clinical armamentarium.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Body surface potential mapping (BSPM) using 180 electrodes in various-sized vests and displayed as a calibrated color map was used to determine the ventricular insertion site of the accessory atrioventricular (AV) connections in 34 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
 Attempts were made to determine the 17 ventricular insertion sites described by Guiraudon et al.
 All 34 patients had an electrophysiologic study (EPS) at cardiac catheterization, and 18 had surgery so the ventricular insertion sites could be accurately located using EPS at surgery.
 A number of physiologic observations were also made with BSPM.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 The following conclusions were drawn: 1) BSPM using QRS analysis accurately predicts the ventricular insertion site of accessory AV connections in the presence of a delta wave in the electrocardiogram; 2) the ventricular insertion sites of accessory AV connections determined by BSPM and by EPS at surgery were identical or within one mapping site (1.5 cm or less) in all but four of 18 cases; three of the four exceptions had more than one accessory AV connection, and the other had a very broad ventricular insertion; 3) BSPM and EPS locations of the accessory AV connections correlated very well in the 34 cases despite the fact that BSPM determines the ventricular insertion site and EPS determines the atrial insertion site of the accessory AV connection; 4) as suggested by the three cases of multiple accessory AV connections, EPS and BSPM may be complementary since BSPM identified one pathway and EPS identified the other (in the case with a broad ventricular insertion, BSPM and EPS demonstrated different proportions of that insertion); 5) BSPM using ST-T analysis is very much less accurate in predicting the ventricular insertion site of accessory AV connections unless there is marked preexcitation; 6) standard electrocardiography using the Gallagher grid methodology (but with no attempt at stimulating maximal preexcitation) was not as accurate as QRS analysis of BSPM in predicting the ventricular insertion site of the accessory AV connection; however, exact comparison is hampered by the different number and size of the Gallagher and Guiraudon insertion sites; 7) BSPM using QRS analysis appears to be very accurate in predicting right ventricular versus left ventricular posteroseptal accessory AV connections; 8) typical epicardial right ventricular breakthrough, indicative of conduction via the specialized AV conduction system, occurs in all patients with left ventricular free wall accessory AV connections; 9) epicardial right ventricular breakthrough was not observed in cases with right ventricular free wall or anteroseptal accessory AV connections; 10) epicardial right ventricular breakthrough can occur in the presence of posteroseptal accessory AV connections, whether right or left ventricular; and 11) the delay in epicardial right ventricular breakthrough in cases with left ventricular insertion may provide a marker to estimate the degree of ventricular preexcitation.

2282,"Probability of rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm after an unrelated operative procedure: a prospective study.
 It has been assumed by some authors that patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms may be at increased risk of rupture after unrelated operations.
 From July 1986 to December 1989, 33 patients (29 men, 4 women) with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm underwent 45 operations.
 Twenty-eight patients had an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, and five patients had a thoracoabdominal aneurysm.
 The abdominal aortic aneurysm ranged in transverse diameter from 3.0 to 8.5 cm (average 5.6 cm).
 Twenty-seven patients underwent a single operation, and six patients had two or more (range of 1 to 6).
 Operations performed were abdominal (13); cardiothoracic (9); head/neck (2); other vascular (11); urologic (7); amputation (2); breast (1).
 General anesthesia was used in 29 procedures, spinal/epidural in 6, and regional/local in 10.
 One postoperative death occurred from cardiopulmonary failure.
 One patient died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at 20 days after coronary artery bypass (1/33 patients [3%]; 1/45 operations [2%]).
 Fourteen patients had repair of their abdominal aortic aneurysm at a later date, an average of 18 weeks after operation.
 Four patients had abdominal aortic aneurysm considered too small to warrant resection (average 3.6 cm).
 Four patients were considered at excessive risk for elective repair.
 The five thoracoabdominal aneurysm were not repaired.
 Four patients are awaiting repair.
 During this same 40-month period, two other patients, not known to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm after another operative procedure, at 21 days and 77 days.
 All three ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms were 5.0 cm or greater in transverse diameter.

2512,"Myocardial perfusion-contraction matching. Implications for coronary heart disease and hibernation.
 Experimental studies demonstrate that short-term regional perfusion-contraction matching, in which the energy demands of regional myocardial contraction are reduced to match the diminished myocardial substrate supply, occurs during states of low coronary blood flow under resting conditions and during exercise-induced ischemia.
 This phenomenon is rapidly reversible and appears to occur in several clinical settings.
 Sustained perfusion-contraction matching is observed in states of partial experimental ischemia of intermediate duration lasting several hours.
 This condition might be called short-term hibernation and resembles clinical conditions such as unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction with some residual perfusion in which the contractile defect can be improved by reperfusion provided the ischemia is not severe enough to cause transmural necrosis.
 Such experimental and clinical observations may or may not relate to the setting of regional dysfunction at rest in patients with chronic coronary heart disease, in whom manifestations of acute ischemia may be absent but improvement of wall motion abnormalities occurs after CABG or balloon angioplasty.
 This condition may constitute the hypothetical state of chronic myocardial hibernation, for which tentative evidence exists from metabolic and perfusion studies using PET.
 Whether such a condition of prolonged perfusion-contraction matching might be associated with adaptive processes that could allow its persistence for long periods without manifest ischemia remains to be investigated.

2329,"Acute hemodynamic effects of captopril in children with a congestive or restrictive cardiomyopathy 
 The acute hemodynamic effects of captopril were evaluated at cardiac catheterization in 16 children (age, 0.3-18 years) with cardiomyopathy.
 Twelve children had congestive cardiomyopathy, whereas four had restrictive cardiomyopathy.
 Hemodynamic measurements were obtained 30 and 60 minutes after the oral administration of captopril (0.5 mg/kg).
 Blood pressures were measured in the aorta, pulmonary artery, right atrium, and pulmonary capillary wedge position; cardiac outputs were measured by the thermodilution technique.
 Hemodynamic data could not be obtained after the administration of captopril in one child with congestive cardiomyopathy because of an immediate, severe hypotensive response.
 In 11 of 12 children with congestive cardiomyopathy, cardiac index increased by 22%, from 2.3 to 2.8 l/min/m2 (p less than 0.05), and stroke volume increased by 22%, from 23 to 28 ml/m2 (p less than 0.05).
 Systemic vascular resistance decreased from 32 to 21 units.m2 (p less than 0.01), but the mean aortic pressure did not change significantly.
 In contrast, four children with restrictive cardiomyopathy had no change in cardiac output after captopril, but there was a trend toward significant arterial hypotension (mean aortic pressure decreased from 78 to 59 mm Hg).
 Thus, captopril acutely reduced systemic vascular resistance and increased both cardiac output and stroke volume in children with congestive cardiomyopathy.
 In children with restrictive cardiomyopathy, however, captopril did not affect cardiac output, but it did decrease aortic pressure.
 These data indicate that captopril may benefit children with a congestive cardiomyopathy but that captopril probably should not be used in children with restrictive disease.

2208,"Recognition and embolic potential of intraaortic atherosclerotic debris.
 Atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta is common in the elderly and patients with clinical coronary artery disease.
 Although embolization can occur from atherosclerotic debris within the thoracic aorta, it is not commonly considered in the differential diagnosis of the source of a systemic embolism.
 In the current study, the prevalence, clinical significance and embolic potential of intraaortic atherosclerotic debris as detected by transesophageal echocardiography was determined.
 Intraaortic atherosclerotic debris was identified in 38 (7%) of 556 patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography.
 An embolic event occurred among 11 (31%) of the 36 study patients with intraaortic atherosclerotic debris.
 The incidence of an embolic event was higher when the debris was pedunculated and highly mobile (8 [73%] of 11 patients) than when it was layered and immobile (3 [12%] of 25 patients) (p less than 0.002).
 Among 15 patients undergoing an invasive procedure of the aorta, the incidence of embolism was 27%.
 In conclusion, in a patient with an embolic event, the thoracic aorta should be considered as a potential source.
 Transesophageal echocardiography can reliably detect intraaortic atherosclerotic debris, and when it is identified, an invasive aortic procedure should be avoided if possible.

2297,"Prognostic importance of delayed Q-wave evolution 3 to 24 hours after initiation of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction.
 The timing of Q-wave evolution and its prognostic significance was studied in 201 patients who received thrombolytic therapy for a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
 One hundred forty-one patients (70%) had evidence of a Q-wave AMI within 3 hours of the initiation of thrombolytic therapy, 31 (16%) developed Q waves after 3 hours but before hospital discharge, and 29 (14%) were discharged with a non-Q-wave AMI.
 Laboratory indicators of myocardial damage and in-hospital morbidity and mortality were greater among patients with Q-wave AMIs than with non-Q-wave AMIs.
 When these indexes were examined with respect to the timing of Q-wave evolution, the prognosis of patients with delayed Q-wave development was similar to that of patients with non-Q-wave AMIs.
 Thus, compared to patients with early (less than or equal to 3 hours) Q-wave evolution, patients with delayed Q-wave evolution or with a non-Q-wave AMI had a smaller creatine kinase peak (mean 661 to 1,081 vs 1,251 to 1,541 IU; p = 0.005), better preservation of left ventricular function as measured by radionuclide ventriculography before discharge (mean +/- standard deviation 54 +/- 11% vs 47 +/- 13%; p less than 0.01), and a lower incidence of congestive heart failure at discharge (3 vs 15%; p = 0.02).
 In-hospital mortality was lower among patients with delayed Q-wave evolution or with a non-Q-wave AMI (5 of 141 vs 0 of 60; difference not significant).

2179,"Exclusion of the Na(+)-H+ antiporter as a candidate gene in human essential hypertension.
 The primary abnormalities that contribute to the pathogenesis of human essential hypertension are unknown.
 The known genetic contribution to this disorder suggests the possible use of genetic linkage analysis to test whether specific candidate genes contribute to the pathogenesis of either essential hypertension or intermediate phenotypes.
 Among such phenotypes, elevated erythrocyte Na(+)-Li+ countertransport (SLC) is the best known, supporting major gene inheritance by pedigree analysis.
 Striking similarities between SLC and Na(+)-H+ exchange suggest that mutations at the Na(+)-H+ antiporter gene locus (APNH) might result in elevated SLC and contribute to the subsequent pathogenesis of hypertension.
 We have tested these hypotheses by genetic linkage analysis, with APNH as a candidate gene.
 By determining genotypes at APNH and flanking loci in pedigrees that support major gene segregation of elevated SLC, we have excluded linkage of APNH and the major SLC locus with a LOD score of -5.91, an odds ratio of almost 1,000,000:1 against linkage.
 In the analysis of 93 hypertensive sibling pairs, we have further demonstrated that APNH explains none of the variance in SLC in hypertensive individuals (r2 = 6 x 10(-7), p greater than 0.99).
 Finally, we have directly tested for linkage of APNH to genes predisposing toward hypertension by linkage in hypertensive sibling pairs.
 Mean allele sharing at APNH is not greater than expected from random assortment in hypertensive siblings (0.92 versus 1.0, p greater than 0.80), and the upper 95% confidence limit of this value (1.04) indicates that mutations at APNH rarely if ever contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension in this population.

2544,"Inability to demonstrate physiologic correlates of subjective improvement among patients taught the relaxation response.
 OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the regular elicitation of the relaxation response produces sustained physiologic changes coincident with symptomatic relief or improved psychological state.
 DESIGN: Prospective, cohort pilot study.
 SETTING: Clinical research center within a teaching hospital.
 PATIENTS: Thirteen athletic men, mean age 44.8 years, with borderline or labile hypertension, taking no medication.
 All 13 completed the study.
 INTERVENTIONS: Three baseline assessments of psychological state, symptom checklist, and assessment of autonomic response to infusion of beta agonist (isoproterenol).
 Daily relaxation response exercises for five consecutive weeks followed by repeat assessment of all parameters.
 Discontinuation of relaxation exercises for subsequent five weeks followed by repeat assessment of all parameters.
 Measurements and main results: After eliciting the relaxation response, subjects demonstrated significant decreases in anxiety (p less than 0.014) and somatic symptoms (p less than 0.02).
 Psychological and somatic variables returned toward baseline after the subsequent discontinuation of relaxation exercises.
 No significant concomitant change in urinary catecholamines, heart rate response to isoproterenol, blood pressure, pulse rate, or serum cholesterol was demonstrated.
 CONCLUSION: The regular elicitation of the relaxation response can improve psychological performance and reduce symptoms.
 However, the physiologic mechanism whereby these psychological and symptomatic improvements occur remains poorly understood and warrants further investigation.

 The nongenetic model was rejected; statistically significant evidence in favor of a genetic model was found.
 Among the many genetic models compared, the most parsimonious genetic model was that susceptibility to abdominal aortic aneurysm is determined by a recessive gene at an autosomal diallelic major locus.
 A multifactorial component in addition to the major locus does not increase the likelihood of the data significantly.

2545,"Cardiac performance in infants referred for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
 We performed cardiac evaluations in 59 infants referred for severe lung disease to determine whether cardiac performance was impaired in those requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
 Infants were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 25) received conventional therapy and group 2 (n = 34) received ECMO therapy after meeting established criteria.
 Ventilatory and oxygenation indexes and estimates of right ventricular systolic pressure were measured.
 Load-dependent and load-independent echocardiographic indexes of cardiac performance were also measured.
 The infants in the two groups had similar diagnoses, age, weight, inotropic support, ventilator and oxygenation indexes on admission, and survival.
 Heart rate and estimates of preload and afterload were similar in the two groups.
 Ventricular shortening fraction was 36.1 +/- 7.6% in group 1 and 40.5 +/- 8.8% in group 2 (p value was not significant).
 Velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (VCF/sec) was 1.41 +/- 0.35 in group 1 and 1.58 +/- 0.39 in group 2 (p value was not significant).
 The relationship between wall stress and ventricular shortening was similar in the two groups.
 There were no differences in cardiac output.
 Pulmonary artery pressure was estimated to be 56 +/- 13 mm Hg in group 1 and 63 +/- 10 mm Hg in group 2 (p = 0.017).
 Thus no significant differences were found in load-dependent or load-independent measures of cardiac performance in infants with severe lung disease treated with ECMO or conventional therapy.
 We conclude that cardiac failure is not the primary cause of clinical deterioration in infants with severe lung disease who require ECMO therapy.

2068,"Reentrant ventricular arrhythmias in the late myocardial infarction period: mechanism by which a short-long-short cardiac sequence facilitates the induction of reentry.
 The electrophysiological mechanism by which a short-long-short stimulated cardiac sequence facilitates the induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmia was investigated in dogs 4 days after ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery.
 In these dogs, reentry develops in the surviving electrophysiologically abnormal epicardial layer that overlies the infarct zone when premature stimulation results in a critically long arc of functional conduction block.
 The activation wavefront circulates around both ends of the arc, coalesces, and conducts slowly distal to the arc before reactivating sites proximal to the arc to initiate a figure-eight reentrant circuit.
 Epicardial isochronal activation maps and effective refractory periods (ERPs) were determined during three different stimulation protocols: A, a basic train of eight beats at a cycle length of 300 msec followed by a single premature stimulus (S2); B, a basic train of eight beats at a cycle length of 300 msec with abrupt lengthening of the last cycle of the train before S2 to 600 msec; C, a basic train of eight beats at a cycle length of 600 msec followed by S2.
 Protocol B was found to result in a differential lengthening of ERP at adjacent sites within the border of the epicardial ischemic zone, whereas protocols A and C induced, respectively, comparable shortening and lengthening of ERPs at the same sites.
 The differential lengthening of ERPs at adjacent sites resulted in an increased dispersion of refractoriness so that a premature stimulus induced functional conduction block between those sites.
 The development of a longer arc of conduction block and, hence, a longer reentrant pathway as well as slower conduction of the circulating wavefront during protocol B allowed more time for refractoriness to expire proximal to the arc and for the circulating wavefront to reexcite those sites to initiate reentry.
 The lengthening of ERP, associated with a single long cycle (protocol B), ranged from 44% to 79% of the total increase in ERP after a series of eight long cycles (protocol C).
 Epicardial sites with longer ERPs located close to the center of the ischemic zone showed more lengthening of refractoriness during protocol B compared with more normal sites near the border of the ischemic zone.
 This strongly suggests that the increased dispersion of refractoriness during protocol B is caused by the shorter memory of ischemic myocardium to the cumulative effects of preceding cycle lengths.

2232,"A systemic non-lytic state and local thrombolytic failure of anistreplase (anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex, APSAC) in acute myocardial infarction.
 The relation between coronary thrombolysis and coagulation variables after administration of anistreplase (anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex, APSAC) was studied in patients with an acute myocardial infarction.
 Fifty eight consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction were given 30 U of anistreplase intravenously within 4 hours of the onset of symptoms.
 A fall in the plasma concentration fibrinogen to less than 1.0 g/l 90 minutes after administration of anistreplase was considered to reflect a systemic lytic state.
 Coronary angiography was performed 48 hours after thrombolytic treatment.
 The overall patency rate was 74% (43/58).
 Patency rates were significantly different in patients with a systemic lytic (83% (43/52)) and a systemic non-lytic state (0% (0/6)).
 The absence of a systemic lytic state after anistreplase administration seemed to be highly predictive of the failure of coronary thrombolysis.
 Coagulation studies showed evidence of inhibition of anistreplase induced fibrinolytic activity which may explain the failure of thrombolytic treatment in patients with evidence of a systemic non-lytic state.

2422,"Divergent effects of serotonin on coronary-artery dimensions and blood flow in patients with coronary atherosclerosis and control patients 
 BACKGROUND.
 Studies in animals have shown that serotonin constricts coronary arteries if the endothelium is damaged, but in vitro studies have revealed a vasodilating effect on isolated coronary segments with an intact endothelium.
 To investigate the effect of serotonin in humans, we studied coronary-artery cross-sectional area and blood flow before and after the infusion of serotonin in seven patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries and in seven with coronary artery disease.
 METHODS.
 We measured the cross-sectional area of the coronary artery by quantitative angiography and coronary blood flow with an intracoronary Doppler catheter.
 Measurements were obtained at base line and during intracoronary infusions of serotonin (0.1, 1, and 10 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per minute, for two minutes).
 We repeated the measurements after an infusion of ketanserin, an antagonist of serotonin receptors that is thought to block the effect of serotonin on receptors in the arterial wall but not in the endothelium.
 RESULTS.
 In patients with normal coronary arteries, the highest dose of serotonin increased cross-sectional area by 52 percent (P less than 0.001) and blood flow by 58 percent (P less than 0.01).
 The effect was significantly potentiated by administration of ketanserin.
 In patients with coronary-artery atherosclerosis, serotonin reduced cross-sectional area by 64 percent (P less than 0.001) and blood flow by 59 percent (P less than 0.001).
 Ketanserin prevented this effect.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Serotonin has a vasodilating effect on normal human coronary arteries; when the endothelium is damaged, as in coronary artery disease, serotonin has a direct, unopposed vasoconstricting effect.
 When considered with other evidence, these data suggest that platelet-derived factors such as serotonin may have a role in certain acute coronary ischemic syndromes.

2153,"A histopathologic study of spinal cord ischemia using an isohistogenic rat upper-half-body transplantation model.
 To study the histopathologic changes of spinal cords exposed to long-duration complete ischemia, the authors developed an upper-half-body transplantation model of inbred rat.
 In this model, an infant Lewis rat is transplanted to the inguinal region of another adult Lewis rat using microsurgical vascular anastomosis.
 Even when 2-week-old donor rats were exposed to complete ischemia for 90 minutes, functions of the spinal cord were comparatively preserved.
 In histopathologic observations, degeneration proportional to complete ischemia duration was noted.
 In the 60-minute ischemia group of 2-week-old donor rats, however, no substantial differences from normal spinal cord were observed.
 Under conditions of equal ischemia duration, it appeared the younger animal had the greater ischemic tolerance.

2207,"Implications of echocardiographically assisted diagnosis of pericardial tamponade in contemporary medical patients: detection before hemodynamic embarrassment.
 Identification of suspected pericardial tamponade and the decision to perform invasive drainage of the pericardial space have historically been based on classic bedside findings.
 Two-dimensional echocardiography has improved detection of pericardial effusion, but it may be excessively sensitive in evaluation of patients for hemodynamic embarrassment.
 Therefore, 50 consecutive medical patients were examined who were identified by echocardiography to have probable tamponade (defined as the presence of right heart chamber collapse in the presence of a pericardial effusion) and who underwent combined right-sided cardiac catheterization and percutaneous pericardiocentesis.
 All patients had elevated pericardial pressure.
 However, many had minimal evidence of hemodynamic compromise (94% had systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg and 58% had a cardiac index greater than or equal to 2.3 liters/min per m2).
 Pericardiocentesis resulted in hemodynamic improvement, but frequently did not alleviate dyspnea or correct tachycardia.
 Patients with malignancy as the cause of tamponade had a high mortality rate (the cumulative probability of survival in such patients was only 17% at 1 year).
 Echocardiographically assisted diagnosis of pericardial tamponade in medical patients results in the identification of a substantial subset of patients with only subtle evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
 This subset of patients differs sharply from medical patients described in previous reports with classic tamponade.
 Although the patients can be managed by invasive catheter pericardiocentesis with few complications, the natural history and the optimal management strategy for this group are not resolved.

2575,"Noninvasive estimation of left atrial pressure in patients with congestive heart failure and mitral regurgitation by Doppler echocardiography.
 A completely noninvasive method for estimating left atrial pressure in patients with congestive heart failure and mitral regurgitation has been devised with the use of continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography and brachial sphygmomanometry.
 Of 46 patients studied with mitral regurgitation, 35 (76%) had jets with distinct Doppler spectral envelopes recorded.
 The peak ventriculoatrial gradient was obtained by measuring peak mitral regurgitant velocity in systole and using the modified Bernoulli equation.
 This gradient was then subtracted from peak brachial systolic blood pressure, an estimate of left ventricular systolic pressure, to yield left atrial pressure (left atrial pressure = systolic blood pressure - mitral regurgitant pressure gradient).
 Noninvasive estimates of left atrial pressure from 35 patients were plotted against simultaneous recordings of mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure resulting in the correlation y = 0.88x + 3.3, r = 0.88, standard error of estimate = +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001).
 Therefore, continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography and sphygmomanometry may be used in selected patients with congestive heart failure and mitral regurgitation for noninvasive estimation of left atrial pressure.

2180,"Methodology of sodium sensitivity assessment. The example of age and sex.
 This article addresses the methodology of sodium sensitivity assessment.
 There have been reports to suggest that a high sodium intake is a cause of elevated blood pressure and trials to indicate that a reduction in sodium intake may reduce blood pressure that is already high; the implications of these findings are discussed.
 Many studies on sodium sensitivity suffer from what could be called the ""normal probability fallacy""; without appropriate control conditions, an intervention such as sodium restriction may incorrectly be assigned to a more pronounced response in a subgroup of the study population.
 As an example, findings are reviewed of age and sex as determinants of a response of blood pressure to variations in sodium intake.
 The limited data available suggest that subjects that are older and have higher blood pressure levels seem to benefit more from a reduction in sodium intake.
 In addition, elderly subjects at a high dietary sodium intake may have a higher risk of developing hypertension.
 Findings in both nonexperimental and experimental studies tend to support this view.
 Findings on sex differences are less consistent.
 A systematic approach to the assessment of factors and mechanisms responsible for sodium sensitivity in some subjects is needed to determine who might benefit most.
 Until more data are available, there is little basis to discriminate sodium-sensitive from sodium-resistant hypertensive subjects.

 The concertina effect is a phenomenon where the QRS complexes reflect alternating phases of gradual widening and narrowing.
 This is most commonly due to ventricular pre-excitation, and the changes in QRS morphology are due to variability of the ventricular zone that undergoes pre-excitation.
 This presentation reflects a case where the concertina effect is due to an idioventricular tachycardia at a rate nearly identical to the sinus rate.
 Variable degrees of ventricular fusion therefore occur, and the concertina effect ensues, in relation to slight variations of the sinus cycle.

 Percutaneous catheter ablation using radiofrequency energy can be used to interrupt atrioventricular (AV) conduction in patients with supraventricular tachycardia refractory to drugs.
 Results of radiofrequency ablation of the AV junction using a custom-designed catheter with a large, 3-mm-long distal electrode, 2-mm interelectrode spacing, and a shaft with increased torsional rigidity were compared with those using a standard quadripolar electrode catheter (Bard EP).
 An electrocoagulator (Microvasive Bicap 4005) supplied unmodulated radiofrequency current at 550 kHz, which was applied between the distal electrode of the ablation catheter and a large skin electrode.
 With use of the modified catheter, 12 of 13 patients (92%) had persistent complete AV block induced with 7 +/- 5 applications of 18 +/- 6 W of radiofrequency power.
 In contrast, complete AV block was produced in only 9 of 18 (50%) historical control patients treated with the standard catheter, despite a similar number of applications (7 +/- 5) and power output (16 +/- 4 W).
 A rise in impedance, due to desiccation of tissue and coagulum formation, occurred earlier (28 +/- 18 vs 52 +/- 24 seconds, p less than 0.001) and more frequently (54 vs 40% of applications, p = 0.047) in patients treated with the standard catheter than in patients treated with the modified catheter.
 The use of a catheter designed to increase the surface area of electrode-tissue contact allows more radiofrequency energy to be delivered before a rise in impedance occurs and appears to increase the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation of the AV junction.

 To examine the spatial resolution of unipolar pace-mapping, 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) recorded during pacing from each of the poles of a quadripolar catheter (5 mm interelectrode distance) were examined.
 Unipolar pacing was performed from each of the poles at late diastolic threshold, twice threshold and 10 mA at a cycle length of 500 ms.
 In 15 patients, pacing was performed at the right ventricular apex and in 14 at various left ventricular sites.
 Pacing from the distal catheter pole at threshold (index ECG) was used to simulate the site of origin of ventricular tachycardia, and all other ECGs were compared with the index ECG.
 Electrocardiograms were evaluated by two independent observers for 1) minor configuration differences (notch, new small component, change in the amplitude of individual components or change in QRS shape); 2) major differences in configuration (new large component, marked change in the amplitude of an existing component or two minor changes); and 3) peak to peak changes in amplitude.
 Minor differences in configuration were seen in a mean 2.4 +/- 1.9, 4.6 +/- 2.4 and 4.4 +/- 2.9 leads during pacing at 5, 10 and 15 mm from the distal electrode (index site).

2061,"Passive smoking and heart disease. Epidemiology, physiology, and biochemistry.
 The evidence that ETS increases risk of death from heart disease is similar to that which existed in 1986 when the US Surgeon General concluded that ETS caused lung cancer in healthy nonsmokers.
 There are 10 epidemiological studies, conducted in a variety of locations, that reflect about a 30% increase in risk of death from ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction among nonsmokers living with smokers.
 The larger studies also demonstrate a significant dose-response effect, with greater exposure to ETS associated with greater risk of death from heart disease.
 These epidemiological studies are complemented by a variety of physiological and biochemical data that show that ETS adversely affects platelet function and damages arterial endothelium in a way that increases the risk of heart disease.
 Moreover, ETS, in realistic exposures, also exerts significant adverse effects on exercise capability of both healthy people and those with heart disease by reducing the body's ability to deliver and utilize oxygen.
 In animal experiments, ETS also depresses cellular respiration at the level of mitochondria.
 The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ETS also accelerate, and may initiate, the development of atherosclerotic plaque.
 Of note, the cardiovascular effects of ETS appear to be different in nonsmokers and smokers.
 Nonsmokers appear to be more sensitive to ETS than do smokers, perhaps because some of the affected physiological systems are sensitive to low doses of the compounds in ETS, then saturate, and also perhaps because of physiological adaptions smokers undergo as a result of long-term exposure to the toxins in cigarette smoke.
 In any event, these findings indicate that, for cardiovascular disease, it is incorrect to compute ""cigarette equivalents"" for passive exposure to ETS and then to extrapolate the effects of this exposure on nonsmokers from the effects of direct smoking on smokers.
 These results suggest that heart disease is an important consequence of exposure to ETS.
 The combination of epidemiological studies with demonstration of physiological changes with exposure to ETS, together with biochemical evidence that elements of ETS have significant adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, leads to the conclusion that ETS causes heart disease.
 This increase in risk translates into about 10 times as many deaths from ETS-induced heart disease as lung cancer; these deaths contribute greatly to the estimated 53,000 deaths annually from passive smoking.
 This toll makes passive smoking the third leading preventable cause of death in the United States today, behind active smoking and alcohol.

2053,"The role of protein kinase C and calcium in the regulation of norepinephrine release from the vascular adrenergic neurons in hypertension.
 This study was designed to investigate the role of protein kinase C and calcium in vascular adrenergic transmission in hypertension.
 In perfused mesenteric vasculatures of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 7 to 10 weeks old) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), we have examined the effects of the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 on endogenous norepinephrine release and vascular responsiveness during nerve stimulation.
 Endogenous norepinephrine release and pressor responses during periarterial nerve stimulation were significantly greater in SHR than in WKY.
 The protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 inhibited the stimulation-induced norepinephrine release and pressor responses in a dose-dependent manner.
 The magnitude of these suppressive responses were more pronounced in SHR than in WKY.
 Calcium removal from extracellular fluid also reduced the norepinephrine release more strongly in SHR than in WKY.
 These results demonstrate that the regulation of norepinephrine release might be more dependent on protein kinase C and calcium in the blood vessels of SHR, which could contribute, at least partially, to the pathogenesis of this form of hypertension.

2583,"Relation of cardiac output at rest and during exercise to age in essential hypertension.
 It has been suggested that the decline of cardiac output with age is due to increased prevalence of disease, particularly occult coronary artery disease.
 Therefore, the relation of cardiac output (direct oxygen Fick method) to age was analyzed in 110 sixteen- to 64-year-old men with World Health Organization stage I or II essential hypertension at the time of the hemodynamic study, who were alive and free of cardiovascular complications 7 years later.
 At supine and seated rest, during upright bicycle exercise at 50 W and and at peak work load, cardiac output was inversely (p less than 0.01) related to age.
 These relations were independent of weight and mean intraarterial pressure.
 Stroke volume decreased with advancing age at supine rest, but not at rest and during exercise in the seated position.
 Heart rate was not affected by age in the supine position, but was slower in older patients during upright rest and at peak exercise.
 In conclusion, in patients with essential hypertension who remained free of cardiovascular complications for 7 years, cardiac output was independently and inversely related to age at various levels of activity.
 These findings suggest that occult cardiovascular disease does not explain the decline in cardiac output with age in patients with essential hypertension.

 Lacunar ischaemic stroke syndromes are clinically, pathophysiologically, and prognostically distinguishable from cortical ischaemic stroke syndromes.
 Could cerebrovascular transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) share similar heterogeneity? 130 patients with TIAs were prospectively studied, 71 of whom underwent carotid angiography.

 These findings support the view that cortical TIAs are associated with ipsilateral extracranial internal carotid artery atheromatous disease, whereas patients with lacunar TIAs may have absent or insignificant large-vessel disease, and probable intracranial small-vessel disease.
 Accurate distinction between lacunar and cortical events may have implications for investigation and treatment of patients with TIAs.

2027,"Anti-atherosclerotic and vasculoprotective actions of calcium antagonists.
 Treatment of hypertension may prevent many of the complications attributable to blood pressure elevation, particularly those that are ""pressure-related,"" such as stroke.
 However, the atherosclerotic complications of hypertension, e.g., coronary artery disease manifested as coronary morbidity and mortality, have not been reduced significantly with antihypertensive therapy.
 This disappointing outcome may reflect the adverse metabolic effects of the traditional therapies, diuretics and beta blockers, and their lack of specific vasoprotective properties.
 Increasing attention is thus being paid to the newer antihypertensive agents, which typically have fewer adverse effects and perhaps more physiologic mechanisms of antihypertensive action.
 Since calcium plays a key role in the genesis of atherosclerosis, calcium antagonists may positively affect the course of vascular disease.
 Investigators have observed that calcium antagonists display clear antiatherosclerotic properties in experimental as well as clinical studies.
 In one recently published clinical study, coronary artery disease was shown to develop more slowly, with a slower progression of individual stenoses, higher regression rate and less frequent occurrence of new lesions in patients treated chronically with verapamil compared to those receiving conventional therapies.
 Other similar investigations are currently under way to evaluate the antiatherogenic properties of calcium antagonists, including the Frankfurt Isoptin Progression Study (FIPS), the Multicenter Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS), the International Nifedipine Trial on Atherosclerosis Coronary Therapy (INTACT), and the large-scale Montreal Heart Institute Study.
 Results of these studies, which use precise end points such as myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction and peripheral vascular disease, may revolutionize the treatment of hypertension by identifying therapeutic approaches that control both the pressure-related and atherosclerotic complications of the disease.

2358,"Percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty in surgical high risk patients.
 Among 126 consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty, 34 were judged to be at high risk for surgery on the basis of age greater than 70 years (n = 13), New York Heart Association functional class IV (n = 11), ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% (n = 3), severe pulmonary hypertension (n = 7), need for associated coronary bypass (n = 4) or additional valve surgery (n = 20) or severe pulmonary disease (n = 3).
 Baseline features of the high risk group were substantially worse than those of the other patients: age (65 +/- 11 versus 49 +/- 12 years; p = 0.0001) and echocardiographic score (9.4 +/- 1.8 versus 8.2 +/- 1.5; p = 0.005) were higher, whereas cardiac output (2.9 +/- 0.9 versus 4.1 +/- 1.2 liters/min; p = 0.0001) and mitral valve area (0.9 +/- 0.4 versus 1.1 +/- 0.3 mm2; p = 0.002) were lower.
 Three high risk patients experienced technical failures and three others had major complications.
 Among the remaining 28 patients, 18 (65%) had a complete hemodynamic success, 4 (14%) an incomplete success and 6 (21%) hemodynamic failure.
 Stepwise logistic regression analysis retained echocardiographic score as the only factor independently predictive of success.
 The percent increase in mitral valve area also correlated with echocardiographic score (r = 0.51, p less than 0.01).

2229,"Rarity of preclinical alcoholic cardiomyopathy in chronic alcoholics less than 40 years of age.
 Preclinical alcoholic cardiomyopathy, myocardial damage in the absence of overt congestive heart failure in chronic alcoholics, is well characterized at necropsy, but attempts to identify such a clinical entity before death have produced conflicting results.
 Studying subjects only at rest, the inclusion of older alcoholics and limitations of noninvasive techniques may explain some of the disagreement.
 To determine if preclinical alcoholic cardiomyopathy could be identified independent of the aforementioned limitations, 25 asymptomatic chronic alcoholics aged less than 40 years (mean 34), each of whom had consumed a minimum of 1 pint of whiskey or one 6-pack of beer greater than or equal to 5 days per week for greater than or equal to 5 years, underwent radionuclide ventriculography for measurements of systolic and diastolic function at rest, peak supine exercise and during recovery, and echocardiography for assessment of chamber size, wall thickness and left ventricular mass.
 Red blood cell levels of selenium and thiamine were measured to determine whether abnormalities were present in these 2 potential mediators of alcoholic cardiomyopathy.
 For comparison, an age-matched group of healthy control subjects was also studied.
 For alcoholics and control subjects at rest, mean ejection fraction (67 +/- 7% vs 71 +/- 6%) and diastolic peak filling rate (3.4 +/- 0.6 vs 3.3 +/- 0.6 end-diastolic volumes per second [EDV/s]) were similar.

2584,"Comparison of the effects of guanadrel sulfate and propranolol on blood pressure, functional capacity, serum lipoproteins and glucose in systemic hypertension.
 In a controlled, double-blind, crossover study, the effects of guanadrel sulfate and propranolol on blood pressure (BP) and selected cardiopulmonary and metabolic variables were compared in 15 physically active and moderately hypertensive subjects.
 Guanadrel sulfate reduced systolic and diastolic BP at rest by -16 and -15 mm Hg, and at maximal exercise by -33 and -13 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.005), without affecting submaximal oxygen consumption (VO2), maximal VO2, ventilatory threshold, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, or fatigue, as assessed by perceived exertion.
 In contrast, propranolol significantly decreased diastolic BP at rest (-16 mm Hg) and systolic BP at maximal exercise (-44 mm Hg); however, it significantly decreased submaximal VO2 (-3.9 ml.kg-1.min-1), maximal VO2 (-3.9 ml.kg-1.min-1), ventilatory threshold (-0.3 liters.min-1), minute ventilation at submaximal exercise (-7.3 liters.min-1), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (-0.27 liters), and concomitantly increased the rating of perceived exertion at maximal exercise (1.9 U).
 Guanadrel sulfate was also associated with significant decreases in mean fasting plasma glucose and total serum cholesterol, whereas propranolol resulted in an increase in serum triglycerides (p less than 0.05).
 In contrast to propranolol, guanadrel sulfate appears to decrease BP without evoking negative metabolic consequences or impairing exercise tolerance.

2247,"Myocardial metabolism of fluorodeoxyglucose compared to cell membrane integrity for the potassium analogue rubidium-82 for assessing infarct size in man by PET 
 Potassium loss from damaged myocardial cells is linearly related to CPK enzyme loss reflecting extent of necrosis.
 The potassium analog, rubidium-82 (82Rb), is extracted after i.v.
 injection and retained in viable myocardium but is not trapped or washed out of necrotic regions.
 To compare myocardial cell metabolism with membrane dysfunction as indicators of necrosis/viability, 43 patients with evolving myocardial infarction and coronary arteriography had positron emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and the potassium analog 82Rb.
 Percent of heart showing FDG defects and 82Rb washout on sequential images indicating failure to retain the potassium analogue were visually assessed and quantified by automated software.
 Infarct size based on rubidium kinetics correlated closely with size and location on FDG images (visual r = 0.93, automated r = 0.82), suggesting that loss of cell membrane integrity for trapping the potassium analog 82Rb parallels loss of intracellular glucose metabolism, both comparable quantitative markers of myocardial necrosis/viability.

2080,"Training increases muscle blood flow in rats with peripheral arterial insufficiency.
 This study investigated the effect of physical training on muscle blood flow (BF) in rats with peripheral arterial insufficiency during treadmill running.
 Bilateral stenosis of the femoral artery of adult rats (300-350 g) was performed to reduce exercise hyperemia in the hindlimb but not limit resting muscle BF.
 Rats were divided into normal sedentary, acute stenosed (stenosed 3 days before the experiment), stenosed sedentary (limited to cage activity), and stenosed trained (run on a treadmill by a progressively intense program, up to 50-60 min/day, 5 days/wk for 6-8 wk).
 Hindlimb BF was determined with 85Sr- and 141Ce-labeled microspheres at a low (20 m/min) and high treadmill speed (30-40 m/min depending on ability).
 Maximal hindlimb BF was reduced to approximately 50% normal in the acute stenosed group.
 Total hindlimb BF (81 +/- 5 ml.min-1.100 g-1) did not change in stenosed sedentary animals with 6-8 wk of cage activity, but a redistribution of BF occurred within the hindlimb.
 Two factors contributed to a higher BF to the distal limb muscle of the trained animals.
 A redistribution BF within the hindlimb occurred in stenosed trained animals; distal limb BF increased to approximately 80% (P less than 0.001) of the proximal tissue.
 In addition, an increase in total hindlimb BF with training indicates that collateral BF has been enhanced (P less than 0.025).
 The associated increase in oxygen delivery to the relatively ischemic muscle probably contributed to the markedly improved exercise tolerance evident in the trained animals.

2318,"Streptokinase treatment for femoral artery thrombosis after arterial cardiac catheterisation in infants and children.
 Data on 205 children who underwent retrograde arterial catheterisation were studied to assess the frequency of femoral artery thrombosis and the safety and efficacy of systemic streptokinase treatment for this complication.
 In 29 (14%) a transarterial balloon dilatation was performed.
 In 15 (7.3%) patients impaired arterial perfusion due to vascular spasm with or without thrombus formation was seen in the cannulated leg after catheterisation.
 Despite heparinisation, signs of impaired arterial circulation persisted in nine patients (4.4% of the total).
 In these patients femoral artery thrombosis was strongly suspected.
 Six (53%) of these had undergone a balloon dilatation.
 Therefore in this study the risk of femoral artery thrombosis developing was 12 times greater after transarterial balloon dilatation than after arterial catheterisation without dilatation (20.6% v 1.7%).
 Systemic infusion of streptokinase was started in all patients with femoral artery thrombosis.
 Arterial perfusion became normal in all patients, though in one this was delayed.
 Haematological monitoring showed lengthening of the thrombin time and a decrease of the fibrinogen concentration during streptokinase treatment.
 There were no serious complications.
 Systemic infusion of streptokinase is a safe and useful treatment in children with persistent femoral artery thrombosis after arterial cardiac catheterisation.

2279,"Traumatic and spontaneous extracranial internal carotid artery dissections.
 Seventy patients with spontaneous and 21 with traumatic extracranial internal carotid artery dissections were studied clinically and angiographically with mean follow-ups of 64 (spontaneous group) and 40 months (traumatic group).
 Sixty percent of the patients in the spontaneous group and 71% in the traumatic group also had follow-up angiograms.
 In traumatic dissections aneurysms were common, significantly fewer aneurysms resolved or became smaller and fewer stenoses resolved or improved, whereas more stenoses progressed to occlusion.
 Traumatic dissections were more likely to leave the patients with neurological deficits.
 A significantly higher percentage of the patients with spontaneous dissections were asymptomatic at follow-up compared with the traumatic group.
 Although both spontaneous and traumatic dissections of extracranial internal carotid arteries mostly carry a good prognosis, the outcome may be somewhat less favorable for the traumatic group.

2174,"Hemodynamic profiles of prostaglandin E1, isoproterenol, prostacyclin, and nifedipine in experimental porcine pulmonary hypertension.
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We compared the hemodynamic effects of four vasodilators in experimental embolic pulmonary hypertension in a randomized controlled trial, using nine pigs weighing 16 to 23 kg.
 After anesthesia induction and cannulation with arterial, central venous, and thermodilution output pulmonary artery catheters, animals were repetitively embolized with glass beads (60 to 160 mu) in order to establish pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure [PAP] doubled from baseline).
 Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), isoproterenol, prostacyclin (PGI2), and nifedipine were compared at doses producing equivalent reduction in systemic BP.
 RESULTS: Only PGE1 and PGI2 decreased both PAP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).
 PGE1 decreased PAP from 39 +/- 1 to 33 +/- 1 mm Hg; prostacyclin decreased PAP from 38 +/- 1 to 31 +/- 1 mm Hg and produced the largest increase in cardiac output (Qt).
 Isoproterenol did not change PAP, markedly increased heart rate (162 +/- 8 to 216 +/- 11 beats/min), and resulted in significant arrhythmias.
 Nifedipine increased PVR from 1044 +/- 113 to 1125 +/- 100 dyne.sec.cm-5 and decreased Qt.
 CONCLUSIONS: Vasodilators demonstrate unique hemodynamic drug profiles.
 Isoproterenol infusion is characterized by tachycardia and arrhythmias.
 Both PGE1 and PGI2 effectively decrease PAP and PVR.
 Nifedipine depressed Qt significantly in this glass-bead embolization model of acute pulmonary hypertension.

2523,"Xanthine oxidase inhibition does not limit canine infarct size.
 BACKGROUND.
 Evidence supporting the role of xanthine oxidase in myocardial reperfusion injury is based on studies with pharmacological interventions used to inhibit enzyme function.
 Controversy exists, however, regarding the true role of xanthine oxidase in reperfusion injury.
 This study was performed to determine whether xanthine oxidase inhibition limits myocardial injury due to coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Anesthetized dogs underwent coronary artery occlusion (90 minutes) and reperfusion (6 hours).
 Oxypurinol (28 mg/kg) or amflutizole (30 mg/kg), chemically unrelated inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, or vehicle was infused intravenously 15 minutes before and 3 hours after reperfusion.
 Regional myocardial blood flow was determined with radiolabeled microspheres.
 Infarct size was determined with the tetrazolium method.
 Myocardial infarct size (percent of risk region) was less in oxypurinol-treated dogs, 32 +/- 16%, compared with that of the control group, 46 +/- 15%.
 Infarct size for the amflutizole-treated dogs, 40 +/- 21%, was not significantly different from that of the control group.
 There were no differences in rate-pressure product or collateral blood flow to account for differences in infarct size.
 Uric acid concentration in the coronary venous plasma increased after reperfusion in the dogs treated with vehicle but not in the drug-treated dogs.
 Xanthine oxidase inhibition was demonstrated in each of the drug treatment groups, but only oxypurinol limited the extent of myocardial injury.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Previously reported cardioprotective effects of allopurinol, noted to occur only when the drug was administered chronically, may be related to a property of oxypurinol, a major metabolite of allopurinol.
 The beneficial effect of oxypurinol is unrelated to inhibition of superoxide formation during xanthine oxidase-catalyzed oxidation of xanthine and hypoxanthine.

2246,"The effects of etomidate on cerebral metabolism and blood flow in a canine model for hypoperfusion.
 The effects of etomidate, a nonbarbiturate cerebral metabolic depressant, on cerebral metabolism and blood flow were studied in 29 dogs during cerebral hypoperfusion.
 Three groups of animals were studied during a 45-minute normotensive and a 30-minute hypotensive period: 10 control animals without etomidate, 11 animals receiving a 0.1-mg/kg etomidate bolus followed by an infusion of 0.05 mg/kg/min etomidate (low-dose group), and eight animals receiving doses of etomidate sufficient to suppress electroencephalographic bursts (high-dose group).
 The mean arterial pressure fell to similar levels (p less than 0.05) during hypotension in all three groups (40 +/- 5, 38 +/- 3, and 27 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively).
 The mean cerebral oxygen extraction fraction rose (p less than 0.05) from 0.23 +/- 0.02 to 0.55 +/- 0.08 in the five control animals tested and from 0.33 +/- 0.02 to 0.53 +/- 0.02 in the seven animals tested in the low-dose group, but did not increase (p greater than 0.05) in the four animals tested in the high-dose group (0.24 +/- 0.03 to 0.23 +/- 0.05).
 Mean cerebral blood flow levels decreased in all groups during hypotension (p less than 0.05): 42 +/- 3 to 21 +/- 4 ml/100 gm/min (52% +/- 12% decrease) in the five animals tested in the control group, 60 +/- 8 to 24 +/- 6 ml/100 gm/min (56% +/- 13% decrease) in the four animals tested in the low-dose group, and 55 +/- 8 to 22 +/- 3 ml/100 gm/min (60% +/- 4% decrease) in the four animals tested in the high-dose group.
 In summary, the cerebral oxygen extraction fraction increased in the control animals and low-dose recipients during hypotension, suggesting the presence of threatened cerebral tissue.
 In contrast, the cerebral oxygen extraction did not change during hypotension when high-dose etomidate was administered.
 It is concluded that high-dose etomidate may preserve the cerebral metabolic state during hypotension in the present model.

2209,"Coronary arterial remodeling studied by high-frequency epicardial echocardiography: an early compensatory mechanism in patients with obstructive coronary atherosclerosis.
 Coronary arterial remodeling is a compensatory mechanism that may limit the adverse effects of coronary obstructive lesions by expansion of the entire vascular segment.
 To determine if this compensatory anatomic change occurs in patients, high-frequency epicardial echocardiography using a 12 MHz transducer was performed during open heart surgery in 33 patients (10 with normal coronary arteries undergoing valvular surgery and 23 with coronary atherosclerosis).
 From stop-frame videotape high-frequency epicardial echocardiographic images, cross-sectional measurements of luminal area and total arterial area (lumen, intima, media and dense adventitia) were made in the patients with atherosclerosis at the site of arterial lesions and from the most proximal portion of the same artery.
 Remodeling was defined as enlargement of the total arterial area.
 In normal arteries measurements were made from proximal and midarterial locations.
 In the patients with normal coronary arteries, total arterial area, as determined by high-frequency echocardiography, decreased from the proximal site to the midportion of the artery (from 10.4 +/- 0.9 to 8.4 +/- 1.0 mm2, p less than 0.05); luminal area also decreased (from 6.0 +/- 0.6 to 4.5 +/- 0.7 mm2, p less than 0.05).
 In patients with coronary arterial lesions, luminal area also decreased from the proximal site to the arterial lesion site (from 5.3 +/- 0.6 to 2.3 +/- 0.3 mm2, p less than 0.05), but total arterial area increased (from 11.6 +/- 1.0 to 13.0 +/- 1.0 mm2, p less than 0.05).
 Of the 25 coronary arteries evaluated, only 4 had angiographic evidence of coronary collateral formation.
 These data indicate that coronary arterial remodeling is an important compensatory mechanism in obstructive coronary disease.

2175,"Effects of milrinone on pulmonary vasculature in normal dogs and in dogs with pulmonary hypertension.
 OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of milrinone on pulmonary vasculature.
 BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that bipyridines or their derivatives may have a selective pulmonary vasodilation effect.
 METHODS: Preliminary study: milrinone administration to 12 normal dogs (low dose [bolus 75 micrograms/kg for 5 min followed by a continuous infusion at 0.75 micrograms/kg.min, n = 6]; high dose [bolus 150 micrograms/kg for 5 min followed by continuous infusion at 1.5 micrograms/kg.min, n = 6]).
 Main study: milrinone administration to 18 dogs with pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary embolism induced by a massive injection of autologous muscle cubes.
 The pulmonary hypertension dogs were divided into three groups: a) group E (n = 6) received embolization only, as control; b) group L (n = 6) received low-dose milrinone; and c) group H (n = 6) received high-dose milrinone, equivalent to the preliminary study group.
 Hemodynamic measurements and blood samplings were obtained at baseline and at 15, 30, and 60 min after start of milrinone infusion.
 RESULTS: Milrinone did not change mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) in normal dogs.
 Milrinone decreased MPAP significantly in dogs with pulmonary hypertension.
 Pulmonary vascular resistance index remained at an almost constant level in normal dogs, but decreased significantly in dogs with pulmonary hypertension.
 Mean arterial pressure was maintained at a constant level in all groups.
 High-dose milrinone administration decreased systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) significantly; low-dose milrinone administration decreased SVRI slightly.
 CONCLUSIONS: Milrinone may have a selective pulmonary vasodilatory effect only in dogs with pulmonary hypertension.
 The mechanism that produced a selectivity on pulmonary vasculature in dogs with pulmonary hypertension is unknown.
 However, an inhibition of platelet aggregation may decrease the MPAP resulting from an increase in cAMP caused by milrinone.
 Further studies are needed to resolve the pulmonary vasodilatory effect of milrinone in dogs with pulmonary hypertension.

2426,"Cavernous malformations and capillary telangiectasia: a spectrum within a single pathological entity.
 Cerebral vascular malformations have traditionally been divided into four categories: arteriovenous, venous, cavernous, and capillary telangiectases.
 A controversy exists about separating the latter two lesions into separate entities.
 Critics claim the distinction is arbitrary but have been unable to present convincing evidence linking the two types of lesions.
 We have reviewed the histories of 20 patients with cavernous malformations and have analyzed the clinical, radiographic, and surgical-autopsy data associated with these lesions.
 In some patients, multiple lesions, including cavernous malformations, capillary telangiectases, and transitional forms between the two, were identified.
 Based on this analysis, we conclude that capillary telangiectasia and cavernous malformations represent two pathological extremes within the same vascular malformation category and propose grouping them as a single cerebral entity called cerebral capillary malformations.

 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the lung as a reperfusion target after limb ischemia-reperfusion, and to measure specifically the oxygen radical response to this reperfusion.
 DESIGN: Paired simple randomized, with continuous interval data in dependent variable and both continuous and nominal independent variables.
 SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTION: Sprague-Dawley male rats (n = 195) were anesthetized and both hind limbs occluded for 3.75 hr, the overnight LD50.
 Alveolar lavage was performed on the animals 1 hr after reperfusion or on survivors 20 hr after reperfusion.
 Groups were either undosed or pretreated with alpha-tocopherol as an antioxidant (50 mg/kg.day) 2 days before ischemia.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence was measured in both phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated and unstimulated macrophages.
 Nanomoles of superoxide radicals per 10(6) alveolar cells/min were also measured using a cytochrome c reduction assay.
 A significant (p less than .01, Student's t-test), time-dependent increase in response of cells from ischemic-reperfused rats was seen.
 Pretreatment with antioxidant had no effect at 1 hr, but significant differences were seen in the 20-hr survivors.
 CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that alveolar lavage cells, 95% macrophages, reflect the reperfusion of ischemic-reperfused hind limbs by a significant increase in oxygen radical activity, an effect partly suppressed in antioxidant-dosed survivors.

2004,"The effects of generation and gender on the joint distributions of lipid and apolipoprotein phenotypes in the population at large.
 The generation and gender effects on the joint distributions of total plasma cholesterol (Total-C), ln triglycerides (lnTrig), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoproteins AI (Apo AI), AII (Apo AII), and E (lnApo E) were studied in 184 male grandparents (MGP), 242 female grandparents (FGP), 237 male parents (MP), 235 female parents (FP), 202 male children (MC), and 200 female children (FC).
 Homogeneity of variance tests revealed that lipid variances were gender and/or generation specific while apolipoprotein variances were homogeneous across strata.
 In the absence of heterogeneity of variance, significant heterogeneity in LDL:lnTrig and lnTrig:Apo AII covariation was found between genders in the parental generation.
 In the presence of heterogeneity of variance, significant heterogeneity of correlation between genders and/or across generations was found for the HDL-C:LDL-C, Total-C:LDL-C, Total-C:lnTrig, lnTrig:LDL-C, Total-C:lnApo E and HDL-C:lnApo E bivariate distributions.
 Analyses of principal components revealed that the generation and gender specific cohorts have similar eigenvalues but distinct eigenvectors for the first two principal components underlying the seven dimensional lipid and apolipoprotein distribution.
 We conclude that the amount of variability explained by the first two principal components is the same across cohorts but how the interindividual variability is distributed among the lipid and apolipoprotein traits is generation and gender specific.
 This study documents the role that variance and covariance might play in determining risk of disease for special subgroups of the population at large.
 It also demonstrates how variances and covariances between risk factors traits characterize life processes of aging and sexual dimorphism.
 This study argues that future biometrical genetic and epidemiological studies of coronary artery disease must take into account age and gender effects on interindividual variability and covariability of risk factors.

 Treatment of female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats with captopril was carried out by the addition of the drug in the drinking water throughout pregnancy and lactation and after weaning.
 At 28 weeks of age, average systolic blood pressure of treated SHR was 113 +/- 3 mm Hg, which was below that of control SHR (188 +/- 3 mm Hg) and WKY rats (124 +/- 3 mm Hg).
 Body weight and heart rate of the SHR were not affected by the treatment.
 Tissue level of catecholamines was increased by captopril treatment in the superior cervical ganglia but remained unchanged in the plasma, heart, mesenteric arteries, and the adrenal glands of both SHR and WKY rats.
 Left ventricular weight, wall thickness, and internal diameter of the left ventricle in the SHR were reduced by the treatment.
 Morphometric measurements of the mesenteric arteries showed that vascular alterations present in the control SHR were prevented by the treatment.
 In the superior mesenteric artery and large mesenteric artery, smaller lumen size at maximal relaxation found in the control SHR was normalized to the level of the WKY rats.
 Hypertrophy of the medial wall in the superior mesenteric, large and small mesenteric arteries, and an increase in the number of smooth muscle cell layers in the large mesenteric artery of the SHR were prevented by the treatment.
 Perfusion study of the mesenteric vascular bed showed that reactivity of these vessels to norepinephrine was reduced, and sensitivity to norepinephrine (as determined by the effective dose that causes 50% of maximal response) was increased in the SHR by captopril treatment.
 Sensitivity of the tail artery in response to norepinephrine was not altered by the treatment.
 We conclude that long-term treatment with captopril of SHR before and after birth prevented the development of hypertension, structural and functional alterations of the mesenteric arteries, and cardiac hypertrophy.

2275,"Ischemia and reperfusion during intermittent coronary occlusion in man. Studies of electrocardiographic changes and CPK release.
 The course of 357 balloon inflations performed during 38 angioplasties for single-vessel coronary artery disease was prospectively studied using continuous ECG recording.
 Ischemic ECG changes appeared during 91 percent of the inflations at a mean of 20 +/- 8 seconds after inflation and resolved in 97 percent of those at a mean of 11 +/- 5 seconds after deflation.
 Elevation of the plasma CPK level was found in six patients who had ischemic ECG changes for at least 7.8 minutes.
 The duration of ischemia did not exceed 5.4 minutes in any of the patients without CPK elevation.
 Resolution of the ischemic changes was delayed in patients with CPK elevation and in last vs initial inflations.
 We conclude that in patients with noninfarcted myocardium, ECG changes follow coronary occlusion and reflow very rapidly, detecting these coronary events with a high sensitivity.
 Lack of rapid regression predicts lack of reperfusion, and persistence of ischemia for more than 7.8 minutes is sufficient to cause myocardial necrosis.

2143,"Lipoprotein-related coronary risk factors in patients with angiographically defined coronary artery disease: relation to number of stenosed arteries.
 To determine whether an index estimating antagonism between low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) would improve separation between groups with and without coronary artherosclerosis, patients undergoing coronary catheterization (35 women and 99 men) were analysed for total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol (HDLc), apolipoprotein A (apo A) and apolipoprotein B (apo B).
 The subjects were categorized as groups 0, 1, 2 or 3 according to the number of stenosed arteries (greater than 75% areal stenosis).
 Thirty of the patients showed no significant coronary atherosclerosis (group 0).
 Serum apo B and TC concentrations were directly related to the number of stenosed vessels, whereas the concentrations of apo A and HDLc were negatively correlated with the number of stenosed arteries.
 An 'atherogenic Index' (ATH index) calculated as the product of serum concentrations of apo B, and TC minus HDLc divided by the product of apo A and HDLc, proved more satisfactory than individual lipoprotein components for discrimination between subjects with and without stenosis.
 Accordingly, identification of coronary groups may be improved by using the ATH index.

 A multicenter trial of alternative techniques for below-knee amputation is described in which surgeons in 11 centers randomized 191 patients with end-stage occlusive vascular disease to two different methods of stump construction.
 The skewflap technique was performed in 98 and the long posterior flap was performed in 93.
 The two groups were well matched in respect to age, sex, smoking, diabetes, and indications for amputation.
 Early outcome was compared in terms of 30-day mortality rate: skew 11 (11%) deaths versus long posterior flap 16 (17%); the state of the wound at 1 week (primary healing 60% in both groups); the need for surgical revision at the same level 7 (7%) versus 7 (8%), and revision to a higher level 10 (10%) versus 7 (8%).
 Follow-up information at 6 months was available from records or by mailed questionnaire in 188 (98%) at 6 months, 20 died during that interval.

 Mexican-American men experience reduced cardiovascular mortality compared with non-Hispanic white men.
 There is no corresponding ethnic difference in cardiovascular mortality in women.
 The difference in men could result either from a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease or a lower case fatality rate among Mexican-Americans.
 Although the incidence of cardiovascular disease in Mexican-Americans is unknown, we have collected data on prevalence of myocardial infarction in 5,148 individuals examined in the San Antonio Heart Study, a population-based survey of cardiovascular disease conducted between 1979 and 1988 in Mexican-Americans and non-Hispanic whites aged 25-64 years.
 Myocardial infarction was assessed by Minnesota-coded electrocardiograms and by a self-reported history of a physician-diagnosed heart attack.
 For both end points, the age-adjusted prevalence of myocardial infarction was lower in Mexican-American men than in non-Hispanic white men.
 After adjustment for age and diabetes status (present/absent), the odds of a myocardial infarction, as defined by either criterion, was approximately one third lower in Mexican-American men than in non-Hispanic white men (p = 0.06).
 In women, the prevalence of both myocardial infarction end points was slightly higher in Mexican-Americans than in non-Hispanic whites, although neither of these differences was significant.
 Although the ethnic differences in prevalence in this study were not statistically significant, their pattern parallels the pattern in the mortality due to cardiovascular diseases.
 Therefore, the results support the hypothesis that the reduced cardiovascular mortality rate observed in Mexican-American men reflects a lower incidence of myocardial infarction rather than a reduced case fatality rate because the latter would result in a higher prevalence.

2451,"Serum sialic acid concentration and cardiovascular mortality 
 OBJECTIVE--To determine whether serum sialic acid concentration may be used to predict short and long term cardiovascular mortality.
 DESIGN--Prospective study on all men and women who had their serum sialic acid concentration measured as part of a general health survey in 1964 or in 1965.
 All were followed up for an average of 20.5 years.
 SETTING--Geographical part of the county of Varmland, Sweden.
 SUBJECTS--Residents in the area participating in a health check up in 1964-5 (27,065 men and 28,037 women), of whom 372 men (169 with incomplete data and 203 lost to follow up) and 345 women (143 and 202 respectively) were excluded; thus 26,693 men and 27,692 women entered the study.
 The study sample was restricted to subjects aged 40-74 during any of the 20 years' follow up.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Serum sialic acid concentration, serum cholesterol concentration, diastolic blood pressure, body mass index at the general health survey visit; cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular deaths during three periods of follow up (0-6 years, 7-13 years, and 14-20 years), according to the Swedish mortality register, in subjects aged 45-74.
 RESULTS--Mean serum sialic acid concentration (mg/100 ml) was 68.8 (SD 8.0) for men and 69.2 (8.0) for women; the average concentration increasing with age in both sexes.
 A total of 5639 (21%) men and 3307 (12%) women died during the follow up period, in whom death in 3052 (54%) men and 1368 (41%) women was from cardiovascular causes.
 During short (0-6 years), medium (7-13 years), and long (14-20 years) term follow up the relative risk of death from cardiovascular disease increased with increasing serum sialic acid concentration.
 The relative risk (95% confidence interval) associated with the highest quartile of sialic acid concentration compared with the lowest quartile was 2.38 (2.01 to 2.83) in men and 2.62 (1.93 to 3.57) in women.
 Similar results were found for deaths from non-cardiovascular disease with relative risks of 1.50 (1.34 to 2.68) in men and 1.89 (1.57 to 2.28) in women, but these relative risks were significantly lower than those for deaths from cardiovascular disease (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.005 respectively).
 In multivariate analysis of total mortality and of cardiovascular mortality with sialic acid concentration, serum cholesterol concentration, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index as independent variables the impact of sialic acid concentration was virtually the same as in univariate analysis.
 CONCLUSION--Serum sialic acid concentration is a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality.
 A possible explanation of these findings is that the serum sialic acid concentration may reflect the existence or the activity of an atherosclerotic process, and this may warrant further investigation.

2248,"Clinical validation of a miniature nuclear probe system for continuous on-line monitoring of cardiac function and ST-segment 
 A new, miniature cesium iodide/photodiode nuclear probe (the ""Cardioscint"") has been developed for continuous on-line measurement of left ventricular function and the ST-segment.
 Ejection fraction (EF) measurements in 77 patients were compared with gated equilibrium radionuclide ventriculograms.
 The probe was positioned over the left ventricle by first using a blind positioning algorithm and then by using the gamma camera.
 Background was measured both manually and automatically.
 There was good correlation between probe (positioned blind) and gamma camera EF with both manual (r = 0.80, n = 65) and automatic (r = 0.78, n = 66) backgrounds.
 Use of the gamma camera did not significantly alter the results.
 Correlation between the probe stroke counts and thermodilution-derived stroke index during atrial pacing in six subjects was also satisfactory (r = 0.69, n = 102).
 Thus, the Cardioscint is able to provide a reliable estimate of EF and can track rapid changes in cardiac volumes.

2423,"Effect of intracoronary serotonin on coronary vessels in patients with stable angina and patients with variant angina 
 BACKGROUND.
 Serotonin, a major product of platelet activation, has potent vasoactive effects in animal models, but its role in human coronary artery disease remains largely speculative.
 METHODS.
 Using quantitative coronary angiography, we compared the effects of the intracoronary infusion of graded concentrations of serotonin (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol per liter) on coronary vessels in two groups of patients with different clinical presentations of coronary disease (nine with stable angina and five with variant angina), with the effects in a control group of eight subjects with normal vessels on angiography.
 RESULTS.
 Normal coronary vessels had a biphasic response to intracoronary serotonin: dilation at concentrations up to 10(-5) mol per liter, but constriction at 10(-4) mol per liter.
 Vessels in patients with stable angina constricted at all concentrations, with mean (+/- SEM) maximal decreases in diameter of 23.9 +/- 3.6, 33.1 +/- 3.9, and 41.7 +/- 3.1 percent from base line in proximal, middle, and distal segments at a serotonin concentration of 10(-4) mol per liter.
 Smooth segments constricted more than irregular segments (42.0 +/- 4.6 vs.
 21.1 +/- 1.6 percent).
 Four patients with stable angina had a marked reduction in collateral filling.
 All the patients with stable angina had angina during the intracoronary infusion of serotonin, and electrocardiographic changes were noted in six.
 All the patients with variant angina had angina, electrocardiographic changes, and localized occlusive epicardial coronary-artery spasm at concentrations of 10(-6) (n = 2) or 10(-5) (n = 3) mol per liter.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Patients with stable coronary disease do not have the normal vasodilator response to intracoronary serotonin, but rather have progressive constriction, which is particularly intense in small distal and collateral vessels.
 Patients with variant angina have occlusive coronary-artery spasm at a dose that dilates normal vessels and causes only slight constriction in vessels from patients with stable angina.
 These findings suggest that serotonin, released after the intracoronary activation of platelets, may contribute to or cause myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease.

2099,"Assessment of stable ischemic heart disease. Which tests are best for which patients?
 An understanding of the importance of various risk factors, the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia, and the appropriate use of various noninvasive and invasive tests is essential for management of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).
 Although coronary angiography remains the ""gold standard"" for diagnosis of CAD, much of the data obtained from risk factor assessment, medical history, and various noninvasive tests provides information that may be even more important than cardiac catheterization data alone for defining prognosis and directing management.

2084,"Crural artery bypass with adjunctive arteriovenous fistula. A modification in distal anastomosis.
 We carried out crural artery bypass with an adjunctive arteriovenous fistula in 8 lower extremities of 7 patients with severe ischemic symptoms and poor distal run-off.
 Mean blood flow rates in the implanted grafts ranged from 43 to 340 ml/min and those of the reconstructed crural arteries from 20 to 100 ml/min.
 A stenotic lesion was noted on postoperative angiogram in one patient and stasis symptoms caused by downward blood flow into the distal veins in another.
 The other patients have remained well with good function of the grafts 1-5 years after surgery.
 We modified the distal corner of the anastomosis as follows: three additional interrupted simple sutures were made on the anterior wall of the concomitant arteriotomy and venotomy incisions after making the common posterior wall of the vessel incisions.
 A vascular pocket formed at the distal corner of the anastomosis prevents stricture at the anastomosis.
 The vein is finally ligated just distal to the fistula to intercept downward blood flow into the distal veins.
 This modification in technique is recommended to prevent stricture of the distal anastomosis and postoperative stasis symptoms.

2379,"Blood-pool radionuclide angiography in patients with a Novacor left ventricular assist device.
 Blood-pool radionuclide angiography was used to investigate the left ventricular function in eight patients who received a Novacor assist device as a bridge-to-cardiac transplantation.
 Studies were performed during maximal and minimal tolerated assist device flows.
 The left ventricular ejection fraction, volumes, cardiac output, and the pump ejection fraction were computer-assessed.
 All patients had severe left ventricular dilation and hypokinesis before insertion of the assist device, with a mean ejection fraction of 18% +/- 4% which improved to 44% +/- 18% (p less than 0.01) during maximal assist device flows, but fell to 25% +/- 15% (p less than 0.01) during minimal flows.
 The ventricular volumes became normal at maximal assist device flow but increased significantly (p less than 0.05) during minimal flow.
 The pump was well visualized and had an ejection fraction of 82% +/- 7%.
 These data indicate that this assist device effectively unloads the left ventricle.
 The deterioration in ejection fraction following decrease in assist device flow is in keeping with the dependency of these patients on the device to sustain adequate hemodynamics.

2618,"Surreptitious ingestion of a long-acting vitamin K antagonist/rodenticide, brodifacoum: clinical and metabolic studies of three cases.
 The vitamin K metabolism of three patients with factitious purpura due to brodifacoum ingestion was studied.
 These patients, who presented with bleeding disorders due to deficiency of the vitamin K-dependent blood clotting proteins, were refractory to vitamin K1 at standard doses and required fresh frozen plasma to control bleeding until large doses of vitamin K1 were used.
 Metabolic studies demonstrated a blockade in vitamin K utilization, consistent with the presence of a vitamin K antagonist, but the patients denied use of anticoagulants.
 Warfarin assays were negative.
 We show that the factitious purpura in each patient was due to the surreptitious ingestion of brodifacoum, a potent second generation long-acting vitamin K antagonist used as a rodenticide.
 The coagulopathies responded to long-term therapy with large doses of vitamin K1.
 The serum elimination half-time for brodifacoum ranged from 16 to 36 days in these patients.
 The anticoagulant effect is of long duration, requiring chronic vitamin K treatment.
 With increasing availability of new rodenticides, factitious purpura due to surreptitious ingestion of these potent vitamin K antagonists is emerging as a new problem, previously associated with warfarin, with important implications for diagnosis and treatment.

2588,"Recombinant lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor inhibits tissue thromboplastin-induced intravascular coagulation in the rabbit.
 Lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor produces feed-back inhibition of tissue factor (tissue thromboplastin)-induced coagulation in the presence of factor Xa Recombinant lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (rLACI) was tested for its ability to modify thromboplastin-induced intravascular coagulation in a rabbit model that allows monitoring of iodine-125 fibrin accumulation/disappearance in the lung and sampling of blood for the measurement of coagulation parameters.
 Infusion of thromboplastin into the rabbit caused a rapid increase of radioactivity over the lungs, possibly due to the accumulation of 125I fibrin in the lungs, followed by a rapid decline of radioactivity, suggestive of removal of fibrin from the lungs.
 Thromboplastin also caused a rapid decrease of systemic fibrinogen that was accompanied by a lengthening of the activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time.
 The effect of coinfusion of rLACI with thromboplastin or bolus injection of rLACI before thromboplastin infusion was studied.
 At a high dose of rLACI (800 micrograms/kg body weight), the thromboplastin-induced radioactivity increase in the lungs and the systemic fibrinogen decrease were completely suppressed.
 The activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time of the plasma samples lengthened, possibly due to the presence of thromboplastin in circulation.
 The thromboplastin-induced radioactivity increase over the lungs was not completely suppressed by lower doses of rLACI (135 to 270 micrograms/kg body weight), but these doses of rLACI prevented systemic fibrinogen decrease.
 At a bolus dose of 23 micrograms/kg body weight, rLACI provided 50% protection of the fibrinogen consumption (fibrinogen decreased to 82% compared with 65% in rabbits treated with thromboplastin alone).
 These results show that rLACI is effective in the inhibition of thromboplastin-induced coagulation in vivo.

2610,"Neutrophil nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase assembly. Translocation of p47-phox and p67-phox requires interaction between p47-phox and cytochrome b558.
 Two of the cytosolic NADPH oxidase components, p47-phox and p67-phox, translocate to the plasma membrane in normal neutrophils stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA).
 We have now studied the translocation process in neutrophils of patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), an inherited syndrome in which the oxidase system fails to produce superoxide due to lesions affecting any one of its four known components: the gp91-phox and p22-phox subunits of cytochrome b558 (the membrane-bound terminal electron transporter of the oxidase), p47-phox, and p67-phox.
 In contrast to normal cells, neither p47-phox nor p67-phox translocated to the membrane in PMA-stimulated CGD neutrophils which lack cytochrome b558.
 In one patient with a rare X-linked form of CGD caused by a Pro----His substitution in gp91-phox, but whose neutrophils have normal levels of this mutant cytochrome b558, translocation was normal.
 In two patients with p47-phox deficiency, p67-phox failed to translocate, whereas p47-phox was detected in the particulate fraction of PMA-stimulated neutrophils from two patients deficient in p67-phox.
 Our data suggest that cytochrome b558 or a closely linked factor provides an essential membrane docking site for the cytosolic oxidase components and that it is p47-phox that mediates the assembly of these components on the membrane.

2619,"Immunochemical and electrophoretic analyses of phosphorylated native and recombinant neutrophil oxidase component p47-phox.
 Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) possess a potent oxygen-dependent microbicidal system that depends on the activity of a stimulus-activated multicomponent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase.
 Patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) lack activity of this oxidase and consequently suffer severe and frequent infections.
 Components of the oxidase include both membrane-bound factors (most notably, cytochrome b559, which is absent in the X-linked form of CGD) and at least two cytosolic factors, one or the other of which is absent in autosomal CGD.
 Patients with CGD, particularly the autosomal type, have defective phosphorylation of proteins in the 44 to 48 Kd range.
 A polyclonal antiserum (B-1) that recognizes cytosolic oxidase components of 47 and 67 Kd was used to identify phosphoproteins in a cell-free oxidase system.
 Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed the identity of the 47-Kd cytosolic protein (p47-phox) recognized by B-1 and the cationic 47-Kd protein that is phosphorylated in normal but not p47-phox-deficient CGD cytosol during activation of the NADPH-dependent oxidase.
 All full-length and C-terminal recombinant p47-phox proteins augmented the superoxide-generating capacity of the cell-free system and were phosphorylated when added to cytosol from normal subjects or from a patient with p47-deficient autosomal CGD.
 These studies provide compelling evidence that the 47-Kd cationic protein that is a substrate for phosphorylation during the activation of PMNs is, in fact, p47-phox, a cytosolic protein previously shown to be critical for normal activity of the NADPH-dependent oxidase of PMNs.

2606,"Variation in hemoglobin F production among normal and sickle cell adults is not related to nucleotide substitutions in the gamma promoter regions.
 Single nucleotide substitutions in the promoter regions of the A gamma- and G gamma-globin genes have been associated with increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production.
 We wished to determine whether these or other unrecognized substitutions in the gamma promoter regions are responsible for the 20-fold variation in HbF production in sickle cell patients or normal adults.
 From a random sampling of 250 sickle cell (SS) patients and 125 normal adults, 17 individuals representing the highest and lowest HbF producers were selected for study.
 All three common restriction fragment length polymorphism beta-globin region haplotypes (Benin, Central African Republic, and Senegal) were found in both the highest and lowest HbF producers with SS disease.
 Using the polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing of the amplified DNA product, we examined the promoter regions of both the A gamma and G gamma genes from -350 bp to +50 bp of the CAP site.
 No mutations were found in either gamma gene promoter region.
 We conclude that nucleotide substitutions in the promoter regions (-350 to +50 bp) of both gamma genes are not responsible for the marked variation in HbF production among SS or normal individuals.

2616,"Danazol.
 Danazol is a synthetic attenuated androgen that can interfere with normal interactions between the pituitary-hypothalamic axis and the gonads.
 These effects are mediated by complex mechanisms, including those in which danazol can compete with natural steroids in binding to androgen receptors or to sex hormone-binding globulin, possibly displacing natural steroids from this protein, and in binding to reactive sites of enzymes required for synthesis of natural steroids, thereby depressing synthesis.
 Because of danazol's impairment of the pituitary-hypothalamic interactions with gonads, it is an effective therapeutic agent for treatment of endometriosis and cystic disease of the breast.
 It is effective in the treatment of hereditary angioneurotic edema, but the mechanism of this therapeutic success is unclear.
 Danazol has been used, without universal success, in the treatment of other gynecologic and certain hematologic disorders.

2598,"Haemopoietic growth factors.
 The availability of recombinant haemopoietic growth factors has permitted more precise in vitro experiments and human in vivo studies to be performed.
 In general, the results have been in accord with expectations from previous in vitro studies.
 The clinical exploitation of the haemopoietic growth factors offers great promise but careful studies are required to define their value.
 The effects of some growth factors are multiple and complex, and it cannot be assumed that improvements in blood cell counts are per se beneficial to the patient under all circumstances.
 Randomized controlled trials with clinical end-points are now essential.
 In the situation of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, large studies would be required to show an improvement in mortality although lesser morbidity would be easier to demonstrate.
 In the field of cancer therapy the major benefit of the haemopoietic growth factors will be if they permit dosage escalation and there is a consequent improvement in response rate and long-term survival.
 This will require careful patient selection and large, probably multicentre, trials.
 It is also likely that such studies will be limited by the development of severe thrombocytopenia and an effective means to ameliorate this (perhaps the elusive thrombopoietin) will be required.
 The possibility of using haemopoietic growth factors as an adjunct to the treatment of severe infections is enticing, but designing a trial to evaluate this possibility is fraught with difficulties.
 Finally, it must be noted that all the studies reported to date use single factors.
 This is just the beginning and the use of other factors and synergistic combinations may give greater efficacy without increased toxicity.

 Fifty-eight consecutive patients with pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, hypoplastic pulmonary arteries with arborization defects, and major aortopulmonary collaterals were entered into a program for staged surgical repair between January 1979 and July 1989.
 Prerepair preparatory procedures were designed to (1) encourage native pulmonary artery growth by increasing blood flow and (2) unifocalize pulmonary blood supply by transplanting or ligating major collaterals.
 A total of 121 staging procedures were performed with an overall mortality of 10.3%.
 One hundred thirty-four major collaterals were either ligated or transplanted.
 Thirty patients eventually underwent hemodynamic repair with an early mortality of 3.3% and late mortality of 10.0%.
 Twenty-six current survivors of repair remain clinically well after a mean follow-up of 3.6 years.
 Ten patients are currently in various stages of preparation.
 Twelve patients (20.7%) failed to achieve minimum requirements for repair after staging and await further palliation or heart-lung transplantation.

 The University of Utah Medical Center has a Prenatal Diagnosis Conference Team composed of obstetricians, pediatricians, geneticists, and other health care professionals.
 These individuals are involved in the care of patients whose pregnancies are at risk for congenital malformations.
 An autopsy protocol was designed to increase the interaction of the pathologist with the Prenatal Diagnosis Conference Team in the evaluation of perinatal death.
 Two years, 1982 and 1987, before and after the protocol was implemented, were selected for retrospective review.
 The autopsies in 1987 made more specific diagnoses compared with those in 1982.
 Additional congenital anomalies were diagnosed, and increased numbers of patients were found to have well-described congenital disorders.
 The number of attempted postnatal autopsy chromosome studies increased and more chromosomal abnormalities were detected.
 The final autopsy diagnoses made in 1987 have provided more information to the physician for genetic or other patient counseling.
 After the protocol was adopted, increased numbers of cases were referred to the Medical Center for evaluation at autopsy.

 Thirty asphyxiated neonates were resuscitated endotracheally with an anaesthetic rebreathing bag.
 The system was not limited either by pressure or by volume and chest movement was used as the criterion for adequate inflation.
 Inflation pressure and flow were recorded during resuscitation, and flow was integrated to obtain volume.
 Median mean pressure over the first 10 inflations was 40 cm H2O and this dropped during later resuscitation to 29 cm H2O.
 The volume delivered did not change significantly, so volume divided by pressure increased from a median of 0.18 to 0.35 ml/kg/cm H2O.
 Fourteen infants formed part of their functional residual capacity with artificial ventilation and five with spontaneous breaths.
 Eleven infants showed no evidence of functional residual capacity formation.
 In the 22 preterm infants there was a strong association between absence of functional residual capacity formation and later hyaline membrane disease that required ventilation.
 We suggest that pressures of more than than 30 cm H2O may be helpful during initial resuscitation and that there should be further study of devices using positive end expiratory pressure for resuscitation of preterm infants.

 The molecular basis of group A xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) was investigated by comparison of the nucleotide sequences of multiple clones of the XP group A complementing gene (XPAC) from a patient with group A XP with that of a normal gene.
 The clones showed a G----C substitution at the 3' splice acceptor site of intron 3, which altered the obligatory AG acceptor dinucleotide to AC.
 Nucleotide sequencing of cDNAs amplified by the polymerase chain reaction revealed that this single base substitution abolishes the canonical 3' splice site, thus creating two abnormally spliced mRNA forms.
 The larger form is identical with normal mRNA except for a dinucleotide deletion at the 5' end of exon 4.
 This deletion results in a frameshift with premature translation termination in exon 4.
 The smaller form has a deletion of the entire exon 3 and the dinucleotide at the 5' end of exon 4.
 The result of a transfection study provided additional evidence that this single base substitution is the disease-causing mutation.
 This single base substitution creates a new cleavage site for the restriction nuclease AlwNI.
 Analysis of AlwNI restriction fragment length polymorphism showed a high frequency of this mutation in Japanese patients with group A XP: 16 of 21 unrelated Japanese patients were homozygous and 4 were heterozygous for this mutation.
 However, 11 Caucasians and 2 Blacks with group A XP did not have this mutant allele.
 The polymorphic AlwNI restriction fragments are concluded to be useful for diagnosis of group A XP in Japanese subjects, including prenatal cases and carriers.

 79 infants with congenitally dislocatable hips diagnosed clinically soon after birth were examined sonographically and randomised in a controlled trial to immediate splinting (n = 41) or sonographic surveillance for 2 weeks (38).
 Infants from this second group were splinted at age 2 weeks if instability persisted (11 of 38) or if sonographic abnormality had shown no improvement (4 of 38).
 Sonographic findings or clinical outcome did not differ between the two groups at birth or at 6 and 12 months' follow-up.
 We conclude that dislocatable hips may be safely watched for 2 weeks after birth to allow spontaneous resolution, but that this approach requires considerable resources and attention to detail.
 Our experience confirms the importance of the dynamic sonographic scan.
 The low specificity (70%) of sonographic examination in the first week of life makes it an unsatisfactory primary method of screening at birth, but it is a most useful adjunct to the clinical screening and management of congenital dislocation of the hip.

 Recent findings indicate that the pemphigus foliaceus (PF) antigen is involved in epidermal cell adhesion and that characteristic PF lesions result from loss of this function as a consequence of autoantibody binding.
 In the present communication we present data on the epitopes involved in the human autoantibody binding to an immunologically reactive murine tryptic fragment of the PF antigen (tf-PF).
 Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that 39 PF sera, obtained from North American, Colombian, and Brazilian patients recognized only calcium-sensitive epitope(s) on the tf-PF.
 Immunofluorescence blocking experiments showed that preincubation with tf-PF completely blocked the immunofluorescence of 80% of the sera when tested on human skin substrate, and 86% of the sera when tested on murine skin substrate.
 These results show that the calcium-sensitive epitope(s) originally recognized on human PF complex, is (are) present on the murine tf-PF and constitute(s) a major antigenic region for the human PF autoantibodies.
 They also implicate this region of the PF antigen in the pathogenesis of PF as well as in epidermal cell adhesion.

 Transferrin (Tf) subtypes were investigated in 128 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the frequencies of TfC subtypes were compared with the results in normal individuals.
 The frequencies of the Tf genes: C1, C2, C3, D1, and D2 were 0.4765, 0.3867, 0.0742, 0.0390 and 0.0234, respectively.
 The frequency of TfC2 gene was significantly higher in these patients (0.3867) compared to the value in the control group (C2 = 0.247).
 The relative risk of RA in association with TfC1C2 type was 2.0, while it was 0.18 in association with TfC1C1 type and the results were statistically significant.
 This paper confirms the significant association between TfC2 and RA.
 Furthermore, it appears from our results that TfC1 homozygous phenotype is protective for the development of RA.
 The results are discussed in the light of earlier suggestions that the TfC2 subtype confers an increased risk of cellular damage by enhancing hydroxyl radical formation, although it is possible that there exists a genetic linkage of Tf variant to some other locus which is influencing susceptibility to RA.

 Under these conditions, leucovorin did not decrease the therapeutic effect of MTX.

2792,"Characterization of 230-kD bullous pemphigoid antigen associated with the detergent-insoluble fraction of cultured keratinocytes.
 The 230-kD protein identified by antibodies from patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP) has a dual location in cultured normal human epidermal keratinocytes: part in a high-speed supernatant of homogenized cells and part in a particulate fraction, where it is resistant to extraction by non-ionic detergent or mild base.
 Antibodies were affinity purified from the particulate 230-kD BP antigen, which can be extracted in the presence of urea.
 The affinity-purified antibodies bind not only the cytosolic 230-kD protein, showing that it is related, if not identical, to the particulate form, but also produce a discontinuous granular pattern by indirect immunofluorescence in the basement membrane zone of rabbit esophagus.
 In stratifying epidermal cultures, expression of the 230-kD BP antigen is limited to basal cells.
 These data are consistent with 230-kD BP antigen involvement in keratinocyte basal cell interaction with extracellular matrix and indicate that the cultured cell may provide a useful model for analysis of 230-kD BP antigen function.

2801,"Treatment of brittle fingernails and onychoschizia with biotin: scanning electron microscopy.
 Pathologic hoof changes in horses and swine can be normalized by administration of biotin.
 This vitamin has been given orally to women with brittle fingernails or onychoschizia.
 The aim of the study was to test whether the favorable clinical results could be corroborated by scanning electron microscopy.
 We investigated the distal ends of the fingernails from 32 persons.
 They were placed into three groups: group A consisted of 10 control subjects with normal nails, group B comprised eight patients with brittle nails studied before and after biotin treatment, and group C was 14 patients with brittle nails in whom the administration of biotin did not coincide exactly with the initial and terminal clipping of the nails.
 The thickness of the nails in group B increased significantly by 25%.
 In group C, the increase was 7%.
 Splitting of the nails were reduced in groups B and C and the irregular cellular arrangement of the dorsal surface of brittle nails became more regular in all nails of group B and in 8 of 11 nails of group C.

 The use of inflated bags or cuffs to measure grip strength is now a well established technique.
 The method does have a number of problems.
 Bags of different diameter and volume were seen to give statistically significantly different pressure readings when squeezed by the same subjects.
 Different initial pressures (from 20 mmHg to 60 mmHg) also gave significantly different results both in laboratory tests on a materials testing machine and when patients with rheumatoid arthritis squeezed the bag.
 The technique of squeezing also affected the results.
 Despite the intrinsic drawbacks of the system, it is likely to remain in general use because of familiarity and convenience.
 We recommend the minimum details required when pneumodynamometer-derived data are published.

 A prospective cross-sectional questionnaire study of 32 patients with psoriasis was carried out in order to validate the use of the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) in psoriasis and compare its sensitivity with the Psoriasis Disability Index (PDI).
 Overall PDI scores, but not overall SIP scores, correlated well with PASI scores (P less than 0.05).
 There was good correlation between the PDI and overall SIP scores (P less than 0.01).
 Psychosocial factors are more severely impaired than physical activities in patients with psoriasis.

2950,"Microcirculation and hemorheology in NIDDM patients.
 The authors studied 10 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and 5 controls matched for age, sex, blood lipids, and smoking habit.
 The two groups were also comparable for hemorheologic characteristics as evaluated by viscosimetry on whole blood, plasma and serum, erythrocyte filtration and aggregation.
 The microcirculation was studied in the subjects of both groups by microalbuminuria determination, retinal fluorangiography, and capillaroscopic examination of the bulbar conjunctive and nail folds.
 None of the patients presented microalbuminuria values higher than the upper limit of normal (20mg/24h).
 Fluoroangiographic alterations were observed in 4 patients, and all 10 presented capillaroscopic alterations at the bulbar conjunctiva (microaneurysms, erythrocyte aggregates) and nail folds (more frequently of the fingers than toes).
 Similar alterations were detected in controls.
 Thus these abnormalities seem independent of hemorheologic values.

 The purpose of this study was to determine whether diuretic and natriuretic effects are altered in response to intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of clonidine in diabetic rats.
 Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by 65 mg/kg i.p.
 injection of streptozocin, and control rats were injected with vehicle 2 wk before the experiment.
 Blood glucose levels were significantly elevated in the diabetic group (26.3 +/- 1.3 mM) compared with the control group (8.4 +/- 1.6 mM).
 Before and during ICV infusion of clonidine (2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 45 min), urine flow and sodium excretion were measured from intact and denervated kidneys in anesthetized diabetic and control rats.
 The ICV infusion of clonidine significantly increased urine flow in both innervated and denervated kidneys from control rats but not from diabetic rats.
 There was a significant increase in sodium excretion during ICV infusion of clonidine from innervated kidneys of control rats, and denervation abolished this effect.
 In diabetic rats, clonidine failed to promote natriuresis from intact kidneys, and similar to control rats, did not promote natriuresis in denervated kidneys.
 This study demonstrates that 1) the diuretic response to the ICV infusion of clonidine is blunted in diabetic rats, and 2) a natriuretic response to the ICV infusion of clonidine is blunted in innervated kidneys of diabetic rats.

2900,"Cross-sectional analysis of renal function in black Americans with NIDDM.
 Our objective was to define glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) in Black Americans with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).
 This was a cross-sectional study of 71 Black NIDDM patients with diagnosed diabetes duration from 1 mo to 21 yr.
 Hyperglycemia was regulated and stabilized before patients were entered into the study.
 GFR and RPF were determined by the clearance of [125I]iothalamate and 131I-labeled hippuran, respectively, with a constant-infusion technique and four urine collection periods.
 Hyperfiltration, as defined by a GFR of greater than 140 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2, was found in 7 of 20 patients (35%) with newly diagnosed (less than 2 yr duration) NIDDM.
 The percentage of patients with hyperfiltration decreased with increasing duration of diagnosed diabetes.
 Decreasing GFR and RPF occurred with increasing duration of diagnosed diabetes.
 In conclusion, renal hemodynamic changes in Black Americans with NIDDM are similar to those known to occur in White populations with IDDM.

2898,"Theoretical and baseline considerations for diet and weight control of diabetes among blacks.
 This article outlines theoretical considerations for diet and weight control of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and identifies factors that may be of particular importance in influencing the success of diet and weight control of NIDDM in the Black population.
 Long-term adherence to dietary or weight-control regimens requires that the patient evaluate and restructure established eating and physical activity patterns.
 With the use of the social action theory as a conceptual framework, this complex behavioral change task can be understood as a function of the interplay of various self-regulatory mechanisms.
 These mechanisms are influenced by the person's capabilities for making changes, his/her physical condition and general health status, the physical and social environmental context, and the person's material and social resources.
 Many of these factors may differ for Blacks and Whites in a direction that suggests a lesser potential for effective diet and weight-loss therapy among Black NIDDM patients.
 For example, compared with Whites, Blacks are more likely to have limited incomes, low educational attainment, ambivalence about weight control, multiple health problems, and high-fat high-sodium low-fiber diets or food preferences.
 However, some evidence suggests that state-of-the-art counseling approaches can be as effective for Blacks as for Whites.
 The challenge is to adapt the types of approaches suggested by the social action theory for culturally appropriate and cost-effective delivery in Black community health-care settings.

2987,"The immunogenetics of hereditary hemochromatosis.
 Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an iron overload disease caused by unregulated intestinal iron absorption, is a recessive HLA-linked disease.
 HH is the most common inherited metabolic disorder with one of every 400 to 500 individuals having both genes and being likely to develop the disease.
 Thus, although the product of the hemochromatosis gene is unknown, its mode of inheritance allows HLA-genotyping of the proband and his/her siblings to be highly predictive of the genetic propensity to develop the clinical features of HH.
 In view of the known immunoregulatory properties of iron and its binding proteins, it is important to determine if the high levels of storage iron in HH influence the immunosurveillance network in HH patients and whether that has any clinical relevance.
 We have defined certain alterations of the effector cells of the cellular arm of the immune system and have studied a patient with HH who had specific immune alterations, including delayed cutaneous-type hypersensitivity anergy, and was diagnosed with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach four years after his HH diagnosis.
 Those findings are consistent with the interpretation that in certain clinical situations of elevated body iron stores, the immunoregulatory balance or environment may be tipped in favor of growth and development of cancer cells.

2929,"The hypothalamic-pituitary axis of streptozotocin-induced diabetic female rats is not normalized by estradiol replacement.
 Studies in diabetic rats have found abnormalities at the hypothalamic, pituitary, and/or ovarian level but have not controlled for changes in estrogen levels induced by diabetes.
 The purpose of this investigation was to study the effect of diabetes on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in ovariectomized rats treated with estradiol (E2).
 Ovariectomized 60 day old female rats were assigned to control (C, n = 42), diabetic (D, n = 47) or insulin-treated diabetic (DI, n = 16) groups.
 Diabetes was induced with an injection of streptozotocin in the D and DI groups.
 In the C, D, and DI groups, estrogen was replaced by implanting blank, 5 micrograms or 20 micrograms E2 pellets sc.
 Pituitary LH responsiveness to GnRH was assessed in C and D animals.
 Anterior hypothalamic and midhypothalamic concentrations of proGnRH and GnRH, pituitary LH and FSH and serum levels of LH, and E2 were measured by RIA.
 Anterior hypothalamic proGnRH concentrations were decreased in diabetic rats treated with 5 micrograms E2 compared to 5 micrograms E2 control animals (P less than 0.05).
 Midhypothalamic GnRH concentrations were also reduced in D vs.
 C animals despite comparable estrogen therapy (P less than 0.004).
 GnRH-stimulated LH levels were greater in E2-treated diabetic females than in similarly treated control rats (P less than 0.001).
 D and DI animals were more sensitive than controls to the inhibitory effect of estrogen on basal LH levels.
 Pituitary LH and FSH content was lower in 20 micrograms E2-replaced animals but was not influenced by the diabetic state.
 These data demonstrate a diabetes-induced decrease in hypothalamic proGnRH and GnRH concentration which is not corrected with E2 replacement.
 The hyper-responsiveness of the diabetic rat pituitary to GnRH also suggests a chronic lack of GnRH stimulation from the hypothalamus but a continued ability of the pituitary to respond to GnRH.

 A supplement of vitamin E decreased plasma triglycerides, platelet lipid biosynthesis, some of the delta 6- and delta 5-desaturase abnormalities, and urine ketone bodies but did not affect the response of platelets to aggregation.
 PP-56 completely normalized the platelet reactivity to ADP and thrombin.
 This was accompanied by normalization of platelet lipid biosynthesis and diabetes-induced abnormalities in delta 6- and delta 5-desaturases.
 PP-56 treatment also reduced the mortality rate and to a certain extent urinary ketone bodies.
 The protective effect of PP-56 on platelet aggregation and mortality rate were dose related.
 PP-56, a molecule derived from phytic acid, seems to exert potent protective effects on some of the manifestations associated with diabetes in rats.

3016,"Pretranslational suppression of a glucose transporter protein causes insulin resistance in adipocytes from patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity.
 A major portion of insulin-mediated glucose uptake occurs via the translocation of GLUT 4 glucose transporter proteins from an intracellular depot to the plasma membrane.
 We have examined gene expression for the GLUT 4 transporter isoform in subcutaneous adipocytes, a classic insulin target cell, to better understand molecular mechanisms causing insulin resistance in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and obesity.
 In subgroups of lean (body mass index [BMI] = 24 +/- 1) and obese (BMI = 32 +/- 2) controls and in obese NIDDM (BMI = 35 +/- 2) patients, the number of GLUT 4 glucose transporters was measured in total postnuclear and subcellular membrane fractions using specific antibodies on Western blots.
 Relative to lean controls, the cellular content of GLUT 4 was decreased 40% in obesity and 85% in NIDDM in total cellular membranes.
 In obesity, cellular depletion of GLUT 4 primarily involved low density microsomes (LDM), leaving fewer transporters available for insulin-mediated recruitment to the plasma membrane (PM).
 In NIDDM, loss of GLUT 4 was profound in all membrane subfractions, PM, LDM, as well as high density microsomes.
 These observations corresponded with decrements in maximally stimulated glucose transport rates in intact cells.
 To assess mechanisms responsible for depletion of GLUT 4, we quantitated levels of mRNA specifically hybridizing with human GLUT 4 cDNA on Northern blots.
 In obesity, GLUT 4 mRNA was decreased 36% compared with lean controls, and the level was well correlated (r = + 0.77) with the cellular content of GLUT 4 protein over a wide spectrum of body weight.
 GLUT 4 mRNA in adipocytes from NIDDM patients was profoundly reduced by 86% compared with lean controls and by 78% relative to their weight-matched nondiabetic counterparts (whether expressed per RNA, per cell, or for the amount of CHO-B mRNA).
 Interestingly, GLUT 4 mRNA levels in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (BMI = 34 +/- 4) were decreased to the same level as in overt NIDDM.
 We conclude that, in obesity, insulin resistance in adipocytes is due to depletion of GLUT 4 glucose transporters, and that the cellular content of GLUT 4 is determined by the level of encoding mRNA over a wide range of body weight.
 In NIDDM, more profound insulin resistance is caused by a further reduction in GLUT 4 mRNA and protein than is attributable to obesity per se.
 Suppression of GLUT 4 mRNA is observed in patients with impaired glucose tolerance, and therefore, may occur early in the evolution of diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

 The prevalence of lactose maldigestion in Greek adults is 75% but the age at which the lactase activity starts declining is not known.
 The prevalences of lactose maldigestion and intolerance were investigated in 150 randomly selected Greek children 5-12 y old by using breath-hydrogen analysis after ingestion of lactose (2 g/kg body wt, maximum 50 g) or 0.240 L of milk.
 Prevalence of lactose maldigestion increased with age (y = -7.30 + 6.49x, r = 0.88, P = 0.004), being 29.4% and 80.0% at ages 5 and 12 y, respectively.
 Before testing, the reported prevalences of milk-related symptoms by children with high and low lactose-digestion capacity were 21.1% and 39.7% (chi 2 = 5.96, P = 0.015), respectively.
 However, the corresponding prevalences of lactose intolerance after ingestion of milk were 7.3% and 8.6% (chi 2 = 0.1, P = 0.72) and only three children had a delta H2 greater than or equal to 20 ppm postprandially.
 Although intestinal lactase activity declines before age 5 y and many Greek children report milk-related symptoms, true malabsorption and intolerance of lactose after a glass of milk is rarely seen at this age.

3007,"Arginine restores cholinergic relaxation of hypercholesterolemic rabbit thoracic aorta 
 BACKGROUND.
 Reduced synthesis of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) may explain impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in hypercholesterolemia.
 Accordingly, we designed studies to determine if endothelium-dependent relaxation in hypercholesterolemic rabbits may be restored by supplying L-arginine, the precursor of EDRF.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Normal or hypercholesterolemic rabbits received intravenous L-arginine (10 mg/kg/min) or vehicle for 70 minutes.
 Subsequently, animals were killed, thoracic aortas were harvested, and vascular rings were studied in vitro.
 Rings were contracted by norepinephrine and relaxed by acetylcholine chloride or sodium nitroprusside.
 Vasorelaxation was quantified by determining the maximal response (expressed as percent relaxation of the contraction) and the ED50 (dose of drug inducing 50% relaxation; expressed as -log M).
 In vessels from hypercholesterolemic animals receiving vehicle, there was a fivefold rightward shift in sensitivity to acetylcholine compared with normal animals (p = 0.05, n = 5 in each group).
 In vessels from hypercholesterolemic animals, L-arginine augmented the maximal response to acetylcholine (83 +/- 16% versus 60 +/- 15%, p = 0.04 versus vehicle) and increased the sensitivity to acetylcholine (ED50 value: 6.7 +/- 0.2 versus 6.2 +/- 0.2, p less than 0.05 versus vehicle).
 Arginine did not affect maximal and EC50 responses to acetylcholine in vessels from normal animals.
 Arginine did not potentiate endothelium-independent responses in either group.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 We conclude that the endothelium-dependent relaxation is normalized in hypercholesterolemic rabbit thoracic aorta by in vivo exposure to L-arginine, the precursor for EDRF.

2947,"Pituitary insulin-like growth factor-I content and gene expression in the streptozotocin-diabetic rat: evidence for tissue-specific regulation.
 Insulinopenic diabetes mellitus in the rat is associated with reduced circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), resulting primarily from decreased IGF-I synthesis in liver and extrahepatic sites.
 Plasma GH levels in these animals are also suppressed, with loss of episodic secretion and decreased pituitary synthesis.
 Intrapituitary IGF-I has been postulated to exert local autocrine/paracrine negative feedback regulation on GH synthesis and secretion.
 The present studies were designed to examine regulation of pituitary IGF-I peptide content and gene expression in insulinopenic streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats compared to that in liver and testis.
 Serum IGF-I levels were reduced by 86% in STZ-diabetic rats together with reduction of IGF-I content in liver (53%) and testis (74%; all P less than 0.001 vs.
 control).
 Concomitantly, liver and testicular IGF-I mRNA levels were reduced by 90% (P less than 0.001 vs.
 control).
 Insulin treatment restored IGF-I peptide levels in serum, liver, and testis toward normal, with a partial but significant increase in liver IGF-I mRNA.
 In contrast, pituitary IFG-I peptide content increased by 69% in STZ-diabetic rats (P less than 0.001 vs.
 control), with no change in IGF-I gene expression.
 Insulin treatment completely reversed the rise of pituitary IGF-I peptide content.
 These results demonstrate a novel discordance in the regulation of IGF-I gene expression and peptide content between pituitary and other tissues in STZ-induced diabetic rats.
 Elevated IGF-I levels in the pituitaries of these animals may partly explain the suppressed GH synthesis and secretion seen in STZ-diabetic rats and provide further evidence for a potential autocrine or paracrine role of pituitary IGF-I in GH regulation.

2944,"Intensive insulin therapy for treatment of type I diabetes.
 Intensive insulin therapy is best defined as a comprehensive system of diabetes management with the patient and management team as partners.
 The system is directed at improvement of glycemia and patient well-being.
 Glycemic targets should be individually defined.
 Frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose, probably at least four times per day, is essential for meticulous control.
 The benefits include improved psychosocial functioning and the potential of lessening the risks of chronic complications of diabetes.
 The risks relate to problems associated with hypoglycemia, which are increased if meticulous glycemic control is sought.
 One of the important elements of intensive therapy is a multiple-component insulin program designed to provide effective insulinemia coinciding with each major meal and continuous basal insulinemia throughout the 24-h day.
 This may be achieved with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple injections with various insulin regimens, although CSII may offer real advantages in terms of the pharmacokinetics of insulin delivery.
 Other pharmacokinetic issues to be considered involve selection of injection sites, timing of premeal insulin, and mixing insulins.
 Many studies have shown that, albeit with effort, excellent glycemic control can be achieved by various intensive insulin-therapy regimens.
 The implementation of a program of intensive therapy involves patient self-management in terms of altering insulin dosages, food intake, and/or activity in an attempt to achieve the target level of glycemia selected.
 In motivated patients willing to embark on such a course of therapy, intensive insulin therapy can be worthwhile.
 It should be considered for all patients with type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.

2884,"Molecular basis of different forms of metachromatic leukodystrophy 
 BACKGROUND.
 Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an autosomal recessive inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of arylsulfatase A.
 Three forms of the disease can be distinguished according to severity and the age at onset: late infantile (1 to 2 years), juvenile (3 to 16), and adult (greater than 16).
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 To understand the molecular basis of the different forms of the disease, we analyzed arylsulfatase A alleles associated with metachromatic leukodystrophy.
 Two alleles (termed I and A) were identified and accounted for about half of all arylsulfatase A alleles among 68 patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy whom we examined.
 Sufficient information was available for 66 of the patients to allow classification of their disease.
 Of the six instances of homozygosity for allele I, all were associated with the late-infantile form of the disease; of the eight instances of homozygosity for allele A, five were associated with the adult form and three with the juvenile form.
 When both alleles were present, the juvenile form resulted (seven of seven instances).
 Heterozygosity for allele I (with the other allele unknown) is usually associated with late-infantile disease, and heterozygosity for allele A with a later onset of the disease.
 The clinical variability can be explained by the different levels of residual arylsulfatase A activity associated with these genotypes.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Like many lysosomal storage disorders, metachromatic leukodystrophy shows clinical heterogeneity that seems to reflect genetic heterogeneity.
 One of the known alleles (allele I) is associated with earlier and more severe disease than the other (allele A).

 In order to evaluate the reliability of clinical assessment of the thyroid gland, two specialists in endocrinology and two younger doctors independently examined 53 patients twice, and assessed whether they had a diffuse goitre, a multinodular goitre, a solitary nodule or a normal gland.
 In 30% of the patients all four observers were in agreement, whereas in 47% and 23% of the patients, two and three different diagnoses were given, respectively.
 Inter-observer variation was determined and kappa values between -0.04 and 0.54 were found.
 Intra-observer variation was smaller, revealing kappa values between 0.44 and 1.00.
 The present study suggests that clinical assessment of the thyroid gland may lead to misclassification of the type of thyroid disease, and thereby to a less than optimal choice of therapy.

 Atropine-induced heart rate in diabetics was significantly lower than that in nondiabetics (95 +/- 14 (SD) bpm vs 109 +/- 12 bpm, P less than 0.001) and were closely related to preoperative orthostatic diastolic blood pressure change (r = 0.60, P less than 0.01).

3050,"Binding and action of insulin-like growth factor I in pituitary tumor cells.
 Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), a target hormone mediating most of the growth effects of GH, suppresses GH gene expression in a feedback regulatory loop, which may be either endocrine or paracrine in nature.
 Although IGF-I has been shown to directly attenuate GH gene transcription, the relationship of IGF-I binding and action in the somatotroph cell remains unclear.
 Therefore, IGF-I binding and action were compared in two different pituitary cell lines both secreting GH.
 Recombinant human IGF-I attenuated GH secretion in GC cells by up to 70% after 48 h in a dose-dependent manner.
 Surprisingly, IGF-I failed to suppress GH secretion in GH3 cells, a clonally related pituitary cell line.
 Binding studies showed that although the KD for IGF-I was similar in both cell types, GC cells contain 3-fold more IGF-I binding sites compared to GH3 cells, possibly explaining their resistance to IGF-I action.
 Nevertheless, both cell lines possessed abundant and similar binding sites for insulin.
 These results imply that the IGF-I signal for GH gene regulation is receptor-mediated and directly correlated with the number of pituitary IGF-I binding sites.
 Availability of pituitary IGF-I binding sites may therefore be important in determining the level of GH expression by the somatotroph.

3079,"Patterns of food hypersensitivity during sixteen years of double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges.
 For 16 years the double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) has been used at the National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine to determine whether adverse reactions to foods do occur in children.
 The objective of these studies was to explore these reproducible adverse reactions and to characterize them.
 Although skin testing was performed on all subjects, a history of an adverse reaction to food and to subsequent DBPCFC were the only criteria for entry into this study.
 Of 480 children studied, 185 (39%) have had positive DBPCFC results.
 In these 480 children, 245 (24%) of 1014 DBPCFCs showed positive results.
 Egg, peanut, and cow milk accounted for 73% of the positive DBPCFC reactions, but many foods produced reactions.
 Skin test results were positive in most children with a positive DBPCFC reaction, but the large number of patients with asymptomatic hypersensitivity limited the accuracy of a positive skin test result alone as a predictor of clinical symptoms during food ingestion.
 Evaluation of results in this large number of children for a prolonged period revealed reproducible patterns of symptoms, timing, and incriminated foods.
 Placebo reactions were rare.
 The procedure was safe.
 Twelve youngsters with a negative DBPCFC result subsequently had positive reactions to open challenges when large amounts of the challenge food were used.
 In each of these cases the reactions were limited to areas of direct contact with the food or could be explained by the larger amount of food ingested during the open challenge.
 Multiple food hypersensitivity has been a rare finding.
 The DBPCFC should be the ""gold standard"" for both research and clinical diagnostic evaluations until it is superseded by methods that have yet to be developed.

3240,"The Canadian cooperative trial of cyclophosphamide and plasma exchange in progressive multiple sclerosis. The Canadian Cooperative Multiple Sclerosis Study Group 
 To find out whether non-specific immunosuppression is beneficial in multiple sclerosis (MS) a randomised, placebo-controlled, single-masked trial was carried out in nine university centres.
 168 patients with clinically or laboratory-supported definite MS in progressive phase (deterioration by at least 1.0 on the expanded disability status scale [EDSS] in the previous year) were randomised to receive intravenous cyclophosphamide and oral prednisone (n = 55); daily oral cyclophosphamide, alternate day prednisone (22 weeks), and weekly plasma exchange (20 weeks) (n = 57); or placebo medications and sham plasma exchange (n = 56).
 All patients were followed for at least 12 months (mean 30.4 months) by a monitoring neurologist, who was aware of treatment allocation, and an evaluating neurologist, who was not.
 The primary analysis was a comparison of rates of treatment failure (worsening of evaluating neurologist's assessment of EDSS by 1.0 or more on two consecutive 6-monthly assessments).
 There were no significant differences among the groups in this primary analysis (19 [35%] treatment failures with cyclophosphamide; 18 [32%] with plasma exchange; 16 [29%] with placebo).
 Nor were there any differences in the proportions improved, stabilised, or worsened at each 6 month assessment or in the mean change in the EDSS at the final assessment (0.81 cyclophosphamide; 0.69 plasma exchange; 0.69 placebo).
 A slight trend favouring the plasma exchange group at 12-24 months of follow-up was not sustained at the final assessment.
 This study fails to confirm previous reports that immunosuppressive treatments result in stabilisation or improvement in progressive MS.

 Flow cytometric 2-color analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) showed a reduction of relative and absolute number of CD4+ CD29+ cells compared to matched healthy individuals.
 This abnormality was more marked in patients with active/very active disease.
 Absolute number of CD4+ CD29+ cells was negatively correlated with spontaneous anti-DNA Ig production that we demonstrated to be a laboratory index strongly correlated with a clinical disease activity score.

 Annatto dye is an orange-yellow food coloring extracted from the seeds of the tree Bixa orellana.
 It is commonly used in cheeses, snack foods, beverages, and cereals.
 Previously reported adverse reactions associated with annatto dye have included urticaria and angioedema.
 We present a patient who developed urticaria, angioedema, and severe hypotension within 20 minutes following ingestion of milk and Fiber One cereal, which contained annatto dye.
 Subsequent skin tests to milk, wheat, and corn were negative.
 The patient had a strong positive skin test to annatto dye, while controls had no response.
 The nondialyzable fraction of annatto dye on SDS-PAGE demonstrated two protein staining bands in the range of 50 kD.
 Immunoblotting demonstrated patient IgE-specific for one of these bands, while controls showed no binding.
 Annatto dye may contain contaminating or residual seed proteins to which our patient developed IgE hypersensitivity.

3095,"IgG subclass concentrations in absolute, partial and transient IgA deficiency in childhood.
 Sixty-seven children with symptomatic IgA deficiency were studied on two separate occasions.
 Eighteen had aIgAd at presentation, and 49 had pIgAd.
 IgA concentrations had risen to the normal range for age in 22.2% of children presenting with aIgAd and 77.6% presenting with pIgAd when restudied at a median interval of 3.2 and 3.0 years, respectively.
 IgG subclass concentrations were measured by enzyme immunoassay in serum samples collected at enrollment from 12 children with aIgAd and 22 children with pIgAd.
 IgG2 and IgG4 concentrations for these 34 children were below the 5th centile for age and sex more frequently than expected (IgG2: chi square 5.8, P less than 0.025; IgG 4: chi square 18.4, P less than 0.0005).
 The prevalence of IgG2 deficiency or IgG4 deficiency did not differ significantly between those with aIgAd and those with pIgAd.
 IgG2 concentrations remained below the 5th centile more frequently than expected when retested in 31 children whose pIgAd had resolved (chi square 4.6, P less than 0.05).
 Children with aIgAd at presentation had IgG1 and IgG2 concentrations above the 95th centile more frequently than expected (IgG1: chi square 19.7, P less than 0.0005; IgG2: chi square 13.5, P less than 0.001) but this was not seen for IgG3 and IgG4 concentrations.
 Children with pIgAd did not have elevated IgG1 or IgG2 concentrations at presentation.
 High IgG1 and IgG2 concentrations in aIgAd may be a compensatory mechanism to afford protection from infection or could be part of a selective secondary response to repeated episodes of infection.

3266,"Major histocompatibility gene products and human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 In the present paper we analyze the role of major histocompatibility gene products, the human leukocyte antigens, in the pathophysiology of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 No association has been found between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) frequencies and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) infection, whereas significant associations have been reported in some populations between some HLA haplotypes and the appearance of either opportunistic infections or secondary cancers.
 With regard to the human leukocyte class I antigens, their role as restriction elements in presenting HIV 1 to virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes seems to be established.
 An increase in the serum levels of their soluble forms that correlate with disease stage has also been demonstrated.
 These circulating molecules could interfere with the immune response to HIV 1 and could contribute to the development of the immunodeficiency.
 Antigenic similarities have been detected between human leukocyte class II antigens and HIV 1 envelope proteins.
 These homologies could explain both the presence in some HIV-positive sera of anti-HLA class II antibodies that mediate the lysis of CD4(+)-HLA class II+ T cells and the false-positive reaction of some HIV-negative sera, which contain anti-HLA class II antibodies, in tests for HIV 1 antibodies.
 Reduced levels of some complement factors (the human leukocyte class III antigens) have been detected in HIV-infected subjects.
 These defects could play a role in the progression of the disease and affect both the clearance of HIV 1 and complement-mediated antibody responses.
 The data reported in this review suggest that HLA antigens may be involved in several steps of the immune deficiency of HIV-infected subjects and thus contribute to the pathophysiology of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

3224,"Abnormalities in airway smooth muscle in fatal asthma. A comparison between trachea and bronchus.
 Tracheal smooth muscle from seven cases of fatal asthma demonstrated an increased contractile response to histamine, acetylcholine, and electrical stimulation of intrinsic cholinergic nerves; impaired relaxation to isoproterenol, and possibly theophylline, was also evident (1).
 Fourth generation bronchial spirals from the same patients were also studied, and these results were compared with those of the trachea and normal bronchi (n = 5).
 In contrast to trachea, contractile responses in asthmatic bronchi to acetylcholine, histamine, and cholinergic nerve stimulation were similar to those in control bronchi.
 The potency of isoprenaline (IC50) was reduced 9.4-fold (p less than 0.003), similar to trachea (4.5-fold), whereas theophylline responses were normal.
 The discrepant results obtained may reflect differences in the disease process, including rates of postmortem change, at the two anatomic sites.

3285,"Major differences in the dynamics of primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.
 In patients with primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), major differences in the pattern and extent of abnormality on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between the two groups have recently been demonstrated.
 In the present study, 24 patients, matched for age, sex, duration of disease, and disability, had serial gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-enhanced MRI over a 6-month period.
 The 12 patients in the secondary progressive group had a total of 109 new lesions over this time (18.2 lesions per patient per year) and 87% of these enhanced.
 Enhancement also occurred within and at the edge of preexisting lesions.
 In contrast, only 20 new lesions were seen in the primary progressive group (3.3 lesions per patient per year) and only one of these enhanced.
 There was no difference in the degree of clinical deterioration between the two groups over the 6-month period.
 These findings may indicate a difference in the dynamics of disease activity between the two forms of progressive MS, particularly in relation to the inflammatory component of the lesions, and have important implications for the selection of patients and the monitoring of disease activity in therapeutic trials.

3089,"European experience of bone-marrow transplantation for severe combined immunodeficiency.
 The outcome of bone-marrow transplantations (BMT) carried out between 1968 and March 1, 1989, in 183 patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) was analysed.
 Recipients of HLA-identical BMTs (70) had a 76% probability of survival (median follow-up 73 months).
 Of the 32 treated since 1983, 97% have been cured (median follow-up 41 months).
 This good prognosis was associated with rapid development of T and B cell function.
 HLA-non-identical, T-cell-depleted, BMT (n = 100) gave significantly lower survival (52%; median follow-up 47 months).
 Factors associated with poor prognosis were the presence of a lung infection before BMT, absence of a protected environment, and use of female donors for male recipients.
 Use of a conditioning regimen significantly increased the frequency of sustained engraftment (86% vs 50% for non-conditioned BMT) and resulted in more frequent engraftment of donor B lymphocytes and myeloid cells.
 Donor B-cell chimerism was strongly associated with the development of normal B-cell function.

3166,"Morphometry of the airways during late responses to antigen challenge in the rat.
 To quantitate the structural changes in the airways that contribute to the late bronchial response (LR) to antigen challenge we killed six Brown-Norway rats, sensitized to ovalbumin (OA) and challenged by aerosol, during the LR and compared the dimensions of the intraparenchymal airways with those of six control animals.
 Lungs were rapidly frozen with liquid nitrogen and fixed in Carnoy's solution.
 Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron.
 At the time of the LR (382 +/- 39 min after OA challenge), RL increased from the baseline value (0.067 +/- 0.034 cm H2O.ml-1.s) by 0.107 +/- 0.03 cm H2O.ml-1.s (p less than 0.05).
 RL did not change significantly in the control rats.
 The lumen size and the wall area of all membranous airways were measured and were corrected for airway size by dividing by the basement membrane length squared (BM2).
 There was no increase in airway wall area in OA-challenged animals.
 However, the lumen of large airways (BM: 2.0 to 2.99 mm) was significantly less for the OA-challenged animals (0.039 +/- 0.0055 mm2) than for the control animals (0.058 +/- 0.0063 mm2; p less than 0.05).
 In six additional rats, the distribution of mast cells (MC) in the bronchial tree was determined.
 Tissues were fixed with Carnoy's solution and stained with a modified May-Grunwald-Giemsa stain.
 There were significantly more MC in the large airways than in medial or small airways.
 We conclude that smooth muscle constriction of large airways and not airway wall edema accounts for the LR in the rat.
 The distribution of the mast cells corresponds closely to the site of bronchoconstriction.

3248,"The evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 quasispecies and the development of immunodeficiency disease.
 This paper presents a theory to explain the development of immunodeficiency disease after a long and variable incubation period of infection with HIV-1.
 Two assumptions are central to the theory: (1) mutation via reverse transcription during viral replication can generate viral strains resistant to neutralization by antibodies specific to earlier mutants in a particular host; (2) the virus can kill the CD4-positive lymphocytes that play a role in mounting an immunological attack directed at the virus.
 The theory is examined via the development of a mathematical model which reveals that an increasing number of antigenically distinct viral strains may overwhelm the immune system of the host.
 As the viral diversity increases beyond a certain level the immune system is unable to suppress the population growth of all the strains simultaneously.
 The intuitive explanation of this pattern of model behaviour lies in the assumption that each virus can kill CD4-positive lymphocytes that are specific to any of the viral strains, but each lymphocyte only directs immunological attack against a single viral strain.

3245,"Lack of benefit of methotrexate in severe, steroid-dependent asthma. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
 OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of low-dose methotrexate in asthmatic patients on steroid use, asthma symptom scores, pulmonary function, airway reactivity, blood cellular components, and immunoglobulin E levels.
 DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled, 13-week clinical trial with follow-up of patients in an open trial of methotrexate at the conclusion of the double-blind study.
 SETTING: An asthma care outpatient clinic.
 PATIENTS: From February 1988 to March 1990, 19 patients with severe, steroid-dependent asthma were enrolled in the study.
 Two of these patients were excluded from analysis.
 INTERVENTIONS: Patients were administered methotrexate or placebo intramuscularly, to assure complete absorption, once weekly during the 13-week study.
 RESULTS: Patients on methotrexate and placebo both significantly decreased their steroid dose by 39.6% (95% CI, 25.1% to 54.1%, P = 0.001) and 40.2% (CI, 17.9% to 67.4%, P = 0.003), respectively.
 Pulmonary function did not differ significantly between the methotrexate and placebo groups.
 In addition, airway reactivity and symptom scores were unchanged on methotrexate or placebo.
 No significant toxicities were seen during the course of the 13-week blinded study, but one patient on methotrexate and prednisone in the follow-up period developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and died.
 Despite continuing methotrexate for up to 1 year, and increasing methotrexate to 30 mg weekly, no significant benefit of methotrexate on asthma control could be shown.
 CONCLUSION: Our study does not support the use of methotrexate in the treatment of severe asthma.

 A cross sectional study was carried out to determine the prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and asthma in 3067 students aged 11-17 years in an urban and a rural area of Guangzhou (Canton), China.
 The methods used included a self administered questionnaire, a histamine bronchial provocation test, and allergen skinprick tests.
 Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was defined as a 20% fall in FEV1 and peak expiratory flow at a provoking dose of histamine (PD20) less than 7.8 mumol on two occasions four weeks apart.
 The response rate was 98.0% and 99.2% in the two areas.
 The prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness was 4.1% and of diagnosed asthma 2.4% in the total population.
 There were no significant differences in prevalence between the urban and the rural area or between boys and girls.
 The 11-12 year group had a higher prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (7.6%) than the older groups.
 Of the 125 with bronchial hyperresponsiveness, 12.0% were defined as having severe or moderate (PD20 less than 0.8 mumol), 26% mild (0.9-3.2 mumol), and 62% slight bronchial hyperresponsiveness (3.3-7.8 mumol).
 The severity of bronchial hyperresponsiveness was closely related to diagnosed asthma, wheezing, and cough, though half the students with bronchial hyperresponsiveness were symptom free.
 The most common allergens were house dust and house dust mite in the city, and hay dust, pollen, and feathers in the rural area.
 The odds ratios for having respectively slight, mild or moderate, and severe bronchial hyperresponsiveness were 5.9, 21.0, and 30.4 for atopy; 1.9, 1.9, and 7.3 for early respiratory infection; and 3.1, 2.5, and 5.6 for a history of parental asthma.

 Ten patients with myeloid leukemias were treated in a phase I trial with escalating doses of mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) M195, reactive with CD33, a glycoprotein found on myeloid leukemia blasts and early hematopoietic progenitor cells but not on normal stem cells.
 M195 was trace-labeled with iodine-131 (131I) to allow detailed pharmacokinetic and dosimetric studies by serial sampling of blood and bone marrow and whole-body gamma-camera imaging.
 Total doses up to 76 mg were administered safely without immediate adverse effects.
 Absorption of M195 onto targets in vivo was demonstrated by biopsy, pharmacology, flow cytometry, and imaging; saturation of available sites occurred at doses greater than or equal to 5 mg/m2.
 The entire bone marrow was specifically and clearly imaged beginning within hours after injection; optimal imaging occurred at the lowest dose.
 Bone marrow biopsies demonstrated significant dose-related uptake of M195 as early as 1 hour after infusion in all patients, with the majority of the dose found in the marrow.
 Tumor regressions were not observed.
 An estimated 0.33 to 1.0 rad/mCi 131I was delivered to the whole body, 1.1 to 6.1 rad/mCi was delivered to the plasma, and up to 34 rad/mCi was delivered to the red marrow compartment.
 131I-M195 was rapidly modulated, with a majority of the bound immunoglobulin G (IgG) being internalized into target cells in vivo.
 These data indicate that whole bone marrow ablative doses of 131I-M195 can be expected.
 The rapid, specific, and quantitative delivery to the bone marrow and the efficient internalization of M195 into target cells in vivo also suggest that the delivery of other isotopes such as auger or alpha emitters, toxins, or other biologically important molecules into either leukemia cells or normal hematopoietic progenitor cells may be feasible.

3255,"Rapid simultaneous detection of multiple retroviral DNA sequences using the polymerase chain reaction and capillary DNA chromatography.
 The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique is a powerful new tool for amplifying target DNA, thus allowing for sensitive detection of specific nucleic acid sequences.
 One important potential use of PCR involves screening the donated blood supply for transfusion-transmitted viruses.
 Realization of this goal has been limited by (1) the requirement for multiple, discrete PCR reactions to amplify and detect target sequences of more than one virus, and (2) the lack of a rapid, nonhazardous means for specific detection of one or more PCR-amplified products.
 We report the simultaneous amplification of three distinct target sequences without discernable loss in sensitivity toward any single target sequence.
 We also demonstrate very rapid separation and detection of PCR-amplified viral DNA through the use of automated capillary DNA chromatography.
 Amplified DNA peaks were initially identified by scanning the capillary effluent at ultraviolet wavelengths, while discrimination of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and human T-cell leukemic virus type I PCR-amplified DNA was accomplished through use of virus-specific, fluorescently labeled primers and probes.
 These results indicate progress toward an automated system for screening the blood supply for nucleic acid sequences of multiple pathogens.

3232,"Limited B cell repertoire in severe combined immunodeficient mice engrafted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from immunodeficient or normal humans.
 The ability to engraft human PBMC or fetal tissue immune cells in the severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse has created a need for characterization of these systems and their application to disease models.
 We demonstrate that SCID mice reconstituted with PBMC support the growth and differentiation of a restricted set of B cells.
 Human IgG levels of 1-2 mg/ml (10-20% of normal human serum levels) were routinely achieved in spite of a serum half life of only 12 d.
 Ig levels peaked around 50 d and Ig production was maintained for greater than 100 d.
 The Ig was greater than 85% IgG though some IgM, IgA, IgD, and even IgE could be detected.
 However, the human IgG produced in hu-PBL-SCID mice was pauci-clonal when analyzed by isoelectric focusing and by kappa/lambda light chain usage.
 Using a new polymerase chain reaction based analysis capable of monitoring individual VH family utilization, we found that the engrafted B cells showed skewed and restricted human VH subfamily utilization.
 These parameters were markedly variable among hu-PBL-SCID mice reconstituted from the same donor cell population at both early (21-50 d) and late stages (greater than 100 d).
 Hu-PBL/CVI-SCID mice constructed with cells from patients with common variable immunodeficiency with an in vitro block in terminal B cell differentiation produced human Ig responses that were quantitatively the same as those produced by hu-PBL-SCID mice from normal donors.
 The hu-PBL-SCID system using PBMC appears to lead to growth and Ig production by a small number of B cells and results in a restricted B cell repertoire.

3275,"Identification of functionally distinct domains of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor using monoclonal antibodies.
 Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a glycoprotein that is required for the survival, growth, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.
 Although the primary structure of GM-CSF is known from cDNA cloning, the relationship between structure and function of GM-CSF is not fully understood.
 Fifteen different monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to human GM-CSF were generated to map immunologically distinct areas of the molecule.
 Each of the MoAbs was biotinylated and shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to bind to recombinant GM-CSF that had been affixed to a solid phase.
 Each of the 15 unconjugated MoAbs was then used to compete with each biotinylated MoAb for binding to GM-CSF.
 These cross-blocking studies identified eight distinct epitopes of native GM-CSF.
 Seven of these epitopes were also present in denatured GM-CSF by Western blotting, and four of the epitopes were at least partially conserved on GM-CSF that was reduced in beta-mercaptoethanol.
 MoAbs to four of eight epitopes neutralized both recombinant (glycosylated and nonglycosylated) and natural human GM-CSF in a GM colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) assay and blocked GM-CSF-induced activation of neutrophils.
 For most of the antibodies there was a good correlation between neutralizing activity and the capacity to block binding of 125I-GM-CSF to neutrophils or blasts.
 Non-neutralizing antibodies to one epitope partially blocked binding of 125I-GM-CSF to neutrophils.
 None of the MoAbs neutralized interleukin-3, G-CSF, or M-CSF.
 The locations of seven of the epitopes could be partially mapped with regard to the amino acid structure by determining reactivity to GM-CSF synthetic peptides or to human-mouse chimeric GM-CSFs.
 The neutralizing antibodies were found to map to amino acids 40-77, 78-94, or 110-127.
 Thus, these MoAbs are useful to identify functional domains of GM-CSF and in identifying regions that are likely to be involved in receptor interaction.

3310,"Oxygen delivery and consumption in head-injured and multiple trauma patients.
 Critically ill patients often demonstrate that whole body oxygen consumption (VO2) is dependent on oxygen delivery (DO2).
 In this retrospective study, the relationship of VO2 to DO2 in patients with isolated head injury (HI, n = 18) was compared to that in patients with multiple trauma (MT, n = 60) without serious head injury.
 Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, central venous pressure, arterial PCO2, cardiac index, and oxygen delivery were significantly lower in HI, but oxygen consumption was not different in the groups.
 In both groups, changes in DO2 (delta DO2) within each patient were significantly correlated with changes in VO2 (delta VO2) in that same patient.
 This relationship was not different between the HI patients, (delta VO2 = (0.20 +/- 0.02) delta DO2), and the MT patients (delta VO2 = (0.17 +/- 0.01) delta DO2).
 When these groups were further divided into those with high hematocrit (greater than 32%) and low hematocrit (less than 32%), HI patients with a low hematocrit demonstrated a steeper regression slope, with 26 +/- 3% of the DO2 change being reflected in the VO2 change.
 This was significantly greater than the slope in HI patients with high hematocrit (13 +/- 3%) and the MT patients at high (19 +/- 2%) or low (16 +/- 2%) hematocrits.
 These data show a correlation between changes in oxygen delivery and consumption that is similar in both head-injury patients and multiple trauma patients without serious head injury.
 This relationship was greatest in head-injured patients at low hematocrit.
 This relationship of VO2 and DO2 in both groups suggests an influence of neurohumoral factors rather than local tissue phenomena.

3507,"Alcohol consumption and synthesis of ethyl esters of fatty acids in adipose tissue.
 Ethyl esters of fatty acids (EEFA) have been found to be formed during ethanol metabolism.
 Human adipose tissue contains high concentrations of free fatty acids, the substrate for EEFA synthesis, and might therefore be a tissue with great potential for EEFA formation.
 In order to explore their potential usefulness as markers of alcohol abuse, the EEFA concentration and the activity of EEFA-synthesizing enzyme were therefore determined in adipose tissue from men belonging to the following categories: teetotalers, social drinkers, alcoholics under treatment, or established alcoholics found to have died as a result of alcohol intoxication.
 In order to estimate the half-life of EEFA and the synthase activity induction, the alcoholics were examined after different time periods of abstinence from alcohol.
 Comparisons were also made with several established markers of alcohol abuse.
 EEFA were not found in teetotalers, and were found in low concentrations in some of the social drinkers.
 EEFA were found in several alcoholics, and the forensic cases had high concentrations.
 EEFA-synthesizing enzyme activity was found in all subjects, increasing from teetotalers to social drinkers, and being 2-fold higher in alcoholics and 5-fold higher in dead alcoholics.
 The induction of the enzyme after abstinence appeared to have a half-life of the order of several weeks.
 Correlations were found between EEFA synthase activity and previously established markers of alcohol abuse known to remain for a long time period after abstinence, such as mean erythrocyte corpuscular volume.
 This preliminary study suggests the possibility that EEFA synthase induction in adipose tissue might have a longer half-life than previously used markers of alcohol abuse.
 It is therefore suggested that the induction of EEFA synthase might be a potentially useful new marker for alcohol abuse because of its apparent proportionality to alcohol intake over a prolonged time period, its presumed specificity, and long-term elevation after alcohol abstinence.
 This potential marker should be analysed further.

 We surveyed 263 junior and senior medical students, and our data support earlier surveys of the prevalence of alcohol abuse and indicate that students tend to drink less heavily and less frequently after entering medical school.
 The clinically proven CAGE questions used in the survey showed statistically significant associations between heavy or frequent drinking before and during medical school, but only 4.2% of respondents indicated that school officials had asked whether they had a drinking or drug abuse problem.
 Given these findings, we suggest the routine administration of screening instruments to medical students, using education and minimal intervention strategies with individuals at risk.

3361,"Management issues for trauma patients with alcohol.
 An estimated 20-25% of patients treated in emergency departments or as inpatients for trauma have been drinking and most of them have BACs of 0.10 gm/dL (22 mmol/L) or higher.
 Many are problem drinkers or alcoholics, smokers, and also abuse other drugs.
 Both acute ingestion and chronic abuse of alcohol increase the frequency and severity of injury, and may complicate patient management by mimicking head trauma, masking intra-abdominal injury, causing circulatory collapse, reducing immune response, altering hepatic metabolism, or causing delirium tremens.
 Proper management of a trauma patient with alcohol includes BAC determination, careful history taking for alcoholism with referral for further evaluation or treatment when indicated, and determination whether other drugs are also being misused.
 Failure to do these may put a physician at legal risk both for improper care of the patient and for exposing others to injury if the patient crashes after being discharged from the emergency department while still impaired by alcohol.

3334,"Substance abuse education in pediatrics.
 Historically, physicians have received little formal education related to alcohol or other drug abuse and dependence.
 A survey of all pediatric programs in the United States was conducted to assess the current status of alcohol/drug education in pediatrics.
 At the medical student and residency training levels, only 44% and 40% of programs, respectively, required any formal instruction, and only 27% and 34%, respectively, offered an elective for medical students or residents.
 Although most respondents endorsed the inclusion of both required and elective alcohol and drug education in the curriculum, few programs that did not include it already had a future plan for it.
 Major impediments identified were curriculum time constraints (86% medical student level, 68% resident level) and the lack of a qualified instructor (55% medical student level, 50% resident level).
 The survey results suggest a strong need for development of faculty and structured alcohol and drug abuse educational plans specific to pediatrics.

3598,"Adequate resuscitation of burn patients may not be measured by urine output and vital signs.
 OBJECTIVE: To compare vital sign and urine output monitoring of seriously burned patients with invasive monitoring during early resuscitation.
 DESIGN: Retrospective review.
 SETTING: A university hospital burn unit.
 PATIENTS: Fourteen seriously burned patients who had pulmonary arterial monitoring.
 Monitoring data were compared at baseline and after fluid challenges.
 RESULTS: There was no correlation between invasively derived physiologic variables and vital signs and urine output.
 Vital signs and urine output changed little after fluid challenge, while variables from invasive monitoring demonstrated significant change.
 In half of the patients, oxygen consumption increased after fluid challenge; vital signs and urine output did not distinguish these patients.
 CONCLUSIONS: The use of urinary output and vital signs to guide initial burn resuscitation may lead to suboptimal resuscitation.
 Invasive cardiorespiratory monitoring may be necessary to optimize resuscitation of seriously burned patients.

3487,"Cocaine metabolite detection in homicide victims.
 We analyzed the blood of homicide victims for the presence of cocaine's major metabolite, benzoylecgonine.
 During 1989 in Fulton County, Georgia, 81% of 275 homicide victims were tested for benzoylecgonine; 40% tested positive.
 The proportions of blacks and victims of firearm injuries who tested positive for benzoylecgonine were significantly larger than the respective proportions for whites and victims of injuries not involving firearms.
 The data show overall proportions of benzoylecgonine positivity much larger than those previously reported in the literature.
 The relationships between homicide, race, firearms, and cocaine use deserve further study.

3597,"Serious childhood injuries caused by air guns.
 OBJECTIVE: To determine the severity of nonfatal injuries to children caused by air guns and pellet guns.
 DESIGN: Case series (hospital chart review).
 SETTING: Inpatient wards of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario.
 PATIENTS: All children under 18 years of age admitted to the hospital from Jan.
 1, 1979, to Dec.
 31, 1989, under ICD code E917, E922, E955, E965, E970 or E985 who had suffered air gun injuries.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Personal data, circumstances of event and clinical data.
 RESULTS: The 43 children (37 boys) had a median age of 12 years.
 The circumstances of the accident were known in 20 cases: 17 children were playing and 3 were cleaning the gun when it went off.
 Four children thought the gun was unloaded.
 In five cases the bullet ricocheted into the eye.
 Nine injuries were self-inflicted.
 Injury was to the extremities in 21 (49%), the eyes in 15 (35%) and the head and neck in 7 (16%).
 The median length of hospital stay was 4 days.
 Six children had long-term disabilities, all the result of eye injuries; two had cataract surgery, and four required enucleation of the eye.
 CONCLUSIONS: Air guns can cause serious injury to children.
 Their sale needs to be banned or at least carefully regulated.

3445,"Assessment of efficacy of activated charcoal for treatment of acute T-2 toxin poisoning.
 ""Superactive"" charcoal was assessed for efficacy in decreasing the lethality of both oral and parenteral exposure to T-2 toxin, a fungal metabolite which can cause death or illness upon ingestion.
 In vitro binding studies, analyzed using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, showed that activated charcoal had a maximal binding capacity of 0.48 mg toxin/mg charcoal and a dissociation constant of 0.078 mg charcoal/l.
 In vivo, orally administered, activated charcoal was assessed for treatment of acute oral or parenteral exposure to T-2 toxin in mice.
 Following oral toxin administration (5 mg/kg), untreated mice showed only 6% survival after 72 hr.
 Charcoal treatment (7 g/kg,po) either immediately or 1 hr after toxin exposure resulted in significant improvement in survival with values of 100% and 75%, respectively.
 Following parenteral toxin exposure (2.8 mg/kg, sc), untreated and charcoal-treated (7 g/kg, po) mice showed 50% and 90% survival, respectively, after 72 hr.
 LD50 value for T-2 toxin, determined at 96 hr after intoxication, increased significantly from 2 mg/kg for untreated controls to 4.5 mg/kg for activated charcoal treatment.

3458,"Splenic trauma: can CT grading systems enable prediction of successful nonsurgical treatment?
 The capability of computed tomographic (CT) grading systems to enable prediction of successful nonsurgical treatment of splenic trauma in children and adults was evaluated.
 Fifty-six patients with documented splenic injury were examined with CT by use of standard trauma protocols.
 Each CT scan was graded according to two recently proposed grading systems.
 The charts of these patients were then reviewed, and correlations between the CT grade and clinical outcome were determined with each grading system.
 Forty patients underwent successful nonsurgical treatment; three of these patients (8%) underwent delayed celiotomy for splenic rupture after failure of nonsurgical treatment.
 Two of these three had grades that indicated nonsurgical treatment was viable.
 In each of these three patients, splenectomy was necessary.
 In the 16 patients who underwent surgery, eight cases (50%) of CT grading errors were documented with surgery.
 In four cases, the extent of the injury was underscored with CT, and in another four cases the injury was overscored.
 It is still not clear whether the severity of splenic injury as defined with CT correlates with clinical outcome.

 30 patients with corneal epithelial defect due to removal of corneal foreign bodies were randomly allocated to receive either chloramphenicol with continuous application of an eyepad or chloramphenicol without the eyepad.
 Almost all corneal defects were healed at 24 h, and all were healed by 48 h, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups.
 Discomfort at 24 h was greater in the eyepad group than in the control group.

3550,"Tears of cruciate ligaments and menisci: evaluation with cine MR imaging.
 A cine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique, involving the acquisition of kinematic sagittal images during knee movement, was used to evaluate 52 symptomatic knee joints.
 Results were compared with those obtained by means of static three-dimensional (3D) MR imaging.
 Twenty-seven of the 28 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears and 22 of 24 normal ligaments were correctly identified at cine MR imaging for a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 92%.
 Static 3D MR imaging yielded a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 88%.
 All four posterior cruciate ligament tears were identified at cine and 3D MR imaging.
 For meniscal tears, cine MR imaging yielded a sensitivity of 48% and a specificity of 96%; the sensitivity and specificity for 3D MR imaging were 71% and 96%, respectively.
 Cine MR imaging proved to be more useful than static MR imaging in assessing the tightness of cruciate ligaments, especially of those that were partially torn, and in assessing the movement of meniscal-free fragments.
 The increased information obtained with cine MR imaging may warrant continued investigation and clinical application.

 Smokers (n = 315) who wished to quit were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to groups using either nicotine or placebo gum.
 Self-reported and observed symptoms of tobacco withdrawal were collected before cessation and at follow-ups of 1 to 2 weeks, 1 month, and 6 months.
 Self-reported and/or observed anger, anxiety, craving, difficulty concentrating, hunger, impatience, and restlessness were the most prominent symptoms of tobacco withdrawal.
 These symptoms had returned to precessation levels by 1 month except increased weight, hunger, and craving continued for 6 months in many smokers.
 Nicotine gum decreased most symptoms, including craving and hunger but not weight.
 Abstinent smokers with more intense withdrawal were not more likely to relapse.

 The culpability, crash-related traffic convictions, and pre- and post-crash driving records of a group of injured impaired (blood alcohol level greater than 80 mg/dl) drivers (N = 58) who were admitted to a Level I trauma center were compared with a group of admitted unimpaired drivers (N = 92).
 Both groups of drivers were 21 years of age or older, sustained moderate injuries (defined as having no injury of the brain, spinal column or cord, extremity, or pelvis with an Abbreviated Injury Score of greater than 2), and were discharged home.
 In the 140 crashes in which culpability was clearly defined, the impaired drivers caused a significantly greater percentage of their crashes (92.7%) compared to unimpaired (64.7%) drivers (p less than 0.001).
 Of the 55 unimpaired drivers who were considered culpable of causing their crashes, 12.7% received a traffic conviction compared with 39.2% of the 51 culpable impaired drivers.
 The mean number of total pre-crash traffic violations was higher for impaired drivers than for unimpaired drivers (p less than 0.01).
 While the mean number of total post-crash convictions for unimpaired and impaired was not significantly different, the mean number of pre- and post-crash alcohol convictions was significantly higher for impaired drivers compared to unimpaired drivers (p less than 0.02).
 The data suggest that injury protects from legal prosecution and does not alter impaired driving practices.

3410,"The Three Rivers Regatta accident: an EMS perspective.
 The Three Rivers Regatta accident occurred on August 7, 1988 when a Formula I racing craft collided with shore, injuring 24 spectators.
 The authors retrospectively examined the prehospital-based response for this multiple-casualty incident that used emergency medical service (EMS) physicians and 32 paramedics stationed at water and land-based posts to triage and evacuate 24 patients in 32 minutes.
 Patients were transported to 5 hospitals including 4 Level I trauma centers; this was accomplished in 53 minutes.
 The EMS response was unique in a number of respects.
 This was a prehospital-based rescue with the entire triage and stabilization phase accomplished by River Rescue units that transported paramedic divers, EMS physicians, and trauma supplies for 30 patients.
 Also of significance was the inordinate proportion of pediatric patients that accounted for 50% (12/24) of the cases.
 Successful medical care was the result of planning based on ""Daily Routine Doctrine"" or escalation of existing treatment protocol; adequate supplies, personnel and transport adapted to local geography and patient population; communications, including all services--EMS, police, and fire; and prehospital physician input to ensure correct triage order and patient disposition.

 The femoral intercondylar notch width was measured in 93 patients with chronic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) insufficiency (Group 1), in 62 patients with an acute tear of the ACL (Group 2), and in 38 fresh anatomic specimen knees (Group 3).
 In six of the specimen knees, further anatomic studies of the intercondylar notch were performed after tissue removal.
 The average intercondylar distance was 16.1 mm in Group 1, 18.1 mm in Group 2, and 20.4 mm in Group 3.
 All differences were highly significant.
 The intercondylar notch was wider in the posterior part and had no crossing bony ridges but had generally concave walls, which provided a functional shelf for the ACL to insert on the lateral side.
 Significant osteophyte formation and stenosis of the anterior outlet of the intercondylar notch occur early in the ACL-deficient knee.
 A narrow anterior outlet of the intercondylar notch without osteophytes was also found in knees with an acute ACL rupture.
 At reconstruction of the ACL, notchplasty should be performed concomitantly.

 To investigate the asbestos burden in a steelplant environment, we counted asbestos bodies (ABs) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 65 steel workers who had retired during the previous 5 y.
 They had worked for at least 15 y in the same area of the plant (coke oven or blast furnace) as maintenance or production workers.
 On the basis of occupational anamnesis, 28 had occasional past professional exposure to asbestos; the remaining 37 workers denied any contact with asbestos.
 A total of 54 white-collar workers who had no occupational exposure to asbestos were included in the study as controls.
 An increased prevalence and concentration of ABs was found in the BALF of steel workers.
 Electron microscopy and EDAX analysis of AB from steel workers revealed that the core fibers were mainly amphiboles.
 More ABs were found in the BALF of maintenance workers than in production workers.
 However, the BALF from steel workers who denied any contact with asbestos revealed an increased AB burden v.
 controls.
 This demonstrates that steel workers may be subject to an occult exposure to amphiboles in the steelplant environment.

 Blunt traumatic rupture of the heart and pericardium, rarely diagnosed preoperatively, carries a high mortality rate.
 From 1979 to 1989, more than 20,000 patients were admitted to a Level I trauma center.
 A retrospective review identified 59 patients requiring emergency surgery for this condition.
 Injuries resulted from vehicular accidents (68%), motorcycle crashes (10%), pedestrians being struck by vehicles (7%), falls (5%), crushing (7%), and being struck by a horse (2%) or crane (2%).
 Seventeen patients (29%) had isolated rupture of the pericardium; 37 (63%) had ruptures of one or more cardiac chambers.
 All patients had signs of life at the scene or during transportation, but only 29 (49%) had vital signs on admission: 15 with chamber injury, 12 with pericardial rupture, and two with combined injuries.
 Diagnosis was established by emergency thoracotomy in the 30 patients who arrived in cardiac arrest.
 In the remaining 29 patients, diagnosis was made by urgent thoracotomy (41%), by subxiphoid pericardial window (34%), during laparotomy (21%), or by chest radiography (3%).
 The overall mortality rate was 76% (45 patients), but only 52% for those with vital signs on admission.

3499,"Administration of interleukin-6 stimulates multilineage hematopoiesis and accelerates recovery from radiation-induced hematopoietic depression.
 Hematopoietic depression and subsequent susceptibility to potentially lethal opportunistic infections are well-documented phenomena following radiotherapy.
 Methods to therapeutically mitigate radiation-induced myelosuppression could offer great clinical value.
 In vivo studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulates pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell (CFU-s), granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cell (GM-CFC), and erythroid progenitor cell (CFU-e) proliferation in normal mice.
 Based on these results, the ability of IL-6 to stimulate hematopoietic regeneration following radiation-induced hematopoietic injury was also evaluated.
 C3H/HeN female mice were exposed to 6.5 Gy 60Co radiation and subcutaneously administered either saline or IL-6 (1,000 micrograms/kg) on days 1 through 3 or 1 through 6 postexposure.
 On days 7, 10, 14, 17, and 22, femoral and splenic CFU-s, GM-CFC, and CFU-e contents and peripheral blood white cell, red cell, and platelet counts were determined.
 Compared with saline treatment, both 3-day and 6-day IL-6 treatments accelerated hematopoietic recovery; 6-day treatment produced the greater effects.
 For example, compared with normal control values (N), femoral and splenic CFU-s numbers in IL-6-treated mice 17 days postirradiation were 27% N and 136% N versus 2% N and 10% N in saline-treated mice.
 At the same time, bone marrow and splenic GM-CFC values were 58% N and 473% N versus 6% N and 196% N in saline-treated mice; bone marrow and splenic CFU-e numbers were 91% N and 250% N versus 31% N and 130% N in saline-treated mice; and peripheral blood white cell, red cell, and platelet values were 210% N, 60% N, and 24% N versus 18% N, 39% N, and 7% N in saline-treated mice.
 These studies demonstrate that therapeutically administered IL-6 can effectively accelerate multilineage hematopoietic recovery following radiation-induced hematopoietic injury.

 The present study was an attempt to replicate these findings on an independent sample of 94 hyperactive boys who were seen at the same clinic, compared with 78 normal controls.
 Assessments were made by clinicians who were blind to group membership.

 As in the previous study, significantly more probands than controls were given ongoing diagnoses of attention-deficit disorder (43% vs 4%), antisocial disorders (32% vs 8%), and drug use disorders (10% vs 1%).
 Furthermore, the absolute rates of these disorders were comparable for corresponding groups across studies, and the adjusted odds ratios did not differ significantly.

3459,"Bullet identification with radiography.
 The authors provide a simple radiographic method for estimating bullet weight and caliber of both deformed and undeformed bullets that enables accurate determination of caliber for the gamut of bullet shapes, with known degrees of confidence.
 The weight-determination procedure is based on the correlation between bullet cross-sectional area, as derived from three orthogonal radiographs, and bullet weight, as determined from a data base of the properties of 48 bullets removed from humans.
 Different equations were developed for bullets weighing 5.8 g or less, or more than 5.8 g.
 For relatively undeformed bullets an additional method calculated caliber directly from the diameter of the bullet body on radiographs.
 Both methods enabled correct prediction of the weight and caliber of the bullets; if one method could not be used, results of the other were reliable.
 Testimony based on these results has been accepted in a local police case and may meet requirements for testimony in U.S.
 court cases involving gunshots.

 Twenty four hour ambulatory ST segment monitoring was performed on 48 members (43 players and five members of the management/technical team) of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) symphony orchestra without a history of cardiac disease.
 This period included final rehearsals and live performances (for audience and radio) of music by Richard Strauss and Mozart at the Royal Festival Hall (n = 36) and Rachmaninov and Tchaikovsky at the Barbican Arts Centre (n = 21).
 During the period of monitoring one person (2%) had transient ST segment changes.
 Mean heart rates were significantly higher during the live performances than during the rehearsals.
 Mean heart rates during the live performance of Rachmaninov and Tchaikovsky were significantly higher than during Strauss and Mozart in those (n = 6) who were monitored on both occasions.
 Mean heart rates in the management and technical team were higher than those of the players.
 The recognised circadian pattern of heart rate, with a peak in the morning waking hours, was altered similarly during both concert days, with a primary peak occurring in the evening hours and a lesser peak in the morning for both musicians and management/technical staff.
 This study showed that environmental factors are of primary importance in defining the circadian pattern of heart rate.

3579,"The occurrence of accessory immunologic cells in bone induction.
 The differentiating tissues in fracture healing and in demineralized bone-powder-induced (DBP) bone formation were investigated with monoclonal antibodies with respect to the occurrence of Ia-positive cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes with interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2).
 Ia refers to molecules on the cell surface belonging to Class II of the major histocompatibility complex and is specific for the species and the individual.
 In both types of granulation tissues (fracture healing and following DBP implantation), the mesenchymal cells from the surrounding musculature were accompanied by large numbers of Ia-positive cells and common macrophages.
 The occurrence of IL-2 receptors was sparse in fracture healing but rich in DBP induction, probably because of its immunogenic properties, though weak.
 On Day 7, almost all existing cells in DBP induction were Ia-positive, signifying an immunologic effector phase apparently directed to the remaining still-passive bone powder in the periphery, while the central part of the inserted bone powder was producing cartilaginous cells and matrix.
 The presence of accessory immunologic cells in fracture healing is perhaps due to a surveillance function (a standard response on injury), but the cell differentiation might also be dependent on the active mediators emitted from Ia-positive cells and macrophages.
 This investigation strengthens the concept that induced bone development occurs in experimental fracture healing.

3554,"Meniscus repair in the anterior cruciate deficient knee.
 From 1979 to 1986, isolated repair of a peripheral vascular zone meniscal tear was performed in 22 patients (23 menisci) who had ACL insufficiency.
 For various reasons none of these patients underwent repair or reconstruction of their ACL.
 The meniscus repair was done by open arthrotomy in 12 cases and by arthroscopic techniques in 11 cases.
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the success rate of a meniscal repair in an anterior cruciate deficient knee.
 The average age of the patients at the time of surgery was 25 years and the average followup was 56 months.
 Six patients (26%) had mild occasional pain not requiring medication and one patient had moderate pain requiring nonnarcotic pain medication.
 Eight patients (26%) had occasional giving way episodes and one of them underwent ACL reconstruction 5 years later because of frequent giving way.
 One patient required a postoperative manipulation for inadequate range of motion, but there were no neurovascular injuries or infections.
 There were three patients (13%) who had failed repairs or a retear and required subsequent subtotal meniscectomies.
 None of the other patients had any clinical symptoms or signs of a meniscal tear.
 There were no significant differences between the results of open or arthroscopic repair.
 Even though the failure rate of meniscus repair may be greater in an unstable knee, we conclude that meniscus repair is not contraindicated in an anterior cruciate deficient knee.

 Zinc deficiency during pregnancy has severe effects in animals.
 To what extent the effects in animals apply to human pregnancy is not known.
 Because the pregnant guinea pig shares characteristics with pregnant women that make it a useful model, three experiments were done with guinea pigs in which Zn intake was reduced beginning on the 30th d of gestation.
 Reduced Zn intake in two of the three experiments resulted in abortion or premature delivery.
 Zinc-supplemented animals with feed intake restricted to that of Zn-deficient animals also aborted or delivered prematurely.
 Zinc-supplemented animals fed for ad libitum access delivered living young at term.
 Fetal/neonatal liver Zn concentration was low in the guinea pigs compared to that reported for other animals and was affected to a lesser extent by low Zn intake by the dam.
 Zinc concentration of neonatal plasma was also less than that in several other species.
 Change in activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme with addition of Zn in vitro was greater in the plasma of Zn-deficient guinea pigs than in that of Zn-adequate guinea pigs and may be useful as an indicator of Zn status.

 Dorsal root ganglionectomy has been suggested as a method for the treatment of chronic intractable radicular pain, with theoretical advantages over dorsal rhizotomy, which does not interrupt ventral root afferents.
 The indications for these procedures in patients with persistent pain following lumbosacral spine surgery are not well established.
 Long-term results have been reported infrequently, and no published series has a mean follow-up period of more than 30 months.
 The authors have reviewed their experience with a series of 13 patients with failed back surgery syndrome, in whom dorsal root ganglionectomy was performed.
 Patients were selected on the basis of clinical presentation and diagnostic root blocks suggesting a monoradicular pain syndrome.
 Follow-up data were obtained at a mean of 5.5 years following dorsal root ganglionectomy.
 Follow-up interviews to assess outcome were conducted by a disinterested third party.
 Treatment ""success"" (at least 50% sustained relief of pain and patient satisfaction with the result) was recorded in two patients at 2 years after surgery and in none at 5.5 years.
 Equivocal success (at least 50% relief, without clearcut patient satisfaction) was recorded in one patient at 2 and at 5.5 years postoperatively.
 Improvements in activities of daily living were recorded in a minority of patients.
 Loss of sensory and motor function was reported frequently by patients.
 A minority of patients had reduced or eliminated analgesic intake.
 These results suggest that dorsal root ganglionectomy has a limited role in the management of failed back surgery syndrome, and that methods to select patients to receive this procedure should be refined or alternative approaches should be considered.

3796,"Incidence of adverse events and negligence in hospitalized patients. Results of the Harvard Medical Practice Study I 
 BACKGROUND.
 As part of an interdisciplinary study of medical injury and malpractice litigation, we estimated the incidence of adverse events, defined as injuries caused by medical management, and of the subgroup of such injuries that resulted from negligent or substandard care.
 METHODS.
 We reviewed 30,121 randomly selected records from 51 randomly selected acute care, nonpsychiatric hospitals in New York State in 1984.
 We then developed population estimates of injuries and computed rates according to the age and sex of the patients as well as the specialties of the physicians.
 RESULTS.
 Adverse events occurred in 3.7 percent of the hospitalizations (95 percent confidence interval, 3.2 to 4.2), and 27.6 percent of the adverse events were due to negligence (95 percent confidence interval, 22.5 to 32.6).
 Although 70.5 percent of the adverse events gave rise to disability lasting less than six months, 2.6 percent caused permanently disabling injuries and 13.6 percent led to death.
 The percentage of adverse events attributable to negligence increased in the categories of more severe injuries (Wald test chi 2 = 21.04, P less than 0.0001).
 Using weighted totals, we estimated that among the 2,671,863 patients discharged from New York hospitals in 1984 there were 98,609 adverse events and 27,179 adverse events involving negligence.
 Rates of adverse events rose with age (P less than 0.0001).
 The percentage of adverse events due to negligence was markedly higher among the elderly (P less than 0.01).
 There were significant differences in rates of adverse events among categories of clinical specialties (P less than 0.0001), but no differences in the percentage due to negligence.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 There is a substantial amount of injury to patients from medical management, and many injuries are the result of substandard care.

3992,"Babies born before arrival at hospital.
 OBJECTIVE--To establish the prevalence of babies born before arrival at two local hospitals.
 To identify women at risk of giving birth before arrival, and the morbidity and mortality associated with such births.
 DESIGN--A case control study.
 Each baby born before arrival and its mother were compared with the next born in the hospital (random control), and one matched for gestation and birthweight, together with their mothers.
 SETTING--Two maternity units serving East Birmingham and Solihull.
 SUBJECTS--All babies (and their mothers) born before arrival at these hospitals from January 1983 to December 1987.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Perinatal mortality rates, patterns of perinatal morbidity, demographic, social and obstetric features of the mothers.
 RESULTS--137 (0.44%) of 31,140 consecutive births were before arrival at hospital (BBA group).
 The perinatal mortality rate in the BBA group was 58.4/1000 (8 deaths) compared with 10.1/1000 for all inborn babies (relative risk 5.8, 95% confidence interval 2.9-11.4).
 In the BBA group the mean birthweight of 3008 g was 212 g (95% CI 50-374 g) less than that in the random control group; the mean gestation of 266 days was 10 days less (95% CI 5.9-14.1 days) than in the random control group.
 Hypothermia was the commonest morbidity.
 Women delivered before arrival tended to be either multigravid inner city Asians living a long way from the hospital or unmarried unbooked younger white Europeans.
 CONCLUSIONS--The high perinatal mortality was related to immaturity and low birthweight, rather than to birth before arrival itself.
 Although groups of mothers at risk of delivery before arrival can be identified more information is needed to establish whether additional antenatal care would be beneficial for these women and their babies.

3976,"Resting metabolic rate and energy balance in amenorrheic and eumenorrheic runners.
 This study investigated metabolic and nutritional factors in association with athletic menstrual dysfunction (AMD).
 Three groups of women were studied: amenorrheic runners (amenorrheic), eumenorrheic runners (eumenorrheic), and eumenorrheic sedentary controls (sedentary).
 Amenorrheic and eumenorrheic were similar in age, weight, percent body fat by hydrodensitometry, training pace and mileage, best 10 km race time, years running, and maximal oxygen consumption.
 When adjusted for body weight or for fat-free mass by analysis of covariance, RMR was significantly lower in amenorrheic than in eumenorrheic and sedentary.
 The daily caloric intakes of the groups did not differ significantly, but the amenorrheic scored significantly higher than the eumenorrheic and sedentary on a scale of aberrant eating patterns.
 Amenorrheic high mileage runners seem to have a less adequate diet than eumenorrheic runners but appear to maintain energy balance and stable weight through a reduction in RMR.

3697,"Cognitive and behavioral effects of the coadministration of dextroamphetamine and haloperidol in schizophrenia.
 OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine if an acute dose of dextroamphetamine might have positive effects on affect and cognition in schizophrenic patients maintained on a regimen of haloperidol and, if so, what variables might predict such improvements.
 METHOD: Twenty-one patients with chronic schizophrenia who were hospitalized on a research ward received a single oral dose of dextroamphetamine (0.25 mg/kg) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.
 All patients were receiving 0.4 mg/kg per day of haloperidol.
 Cognitive tests, motor tests, global ratings, mood ratings, and videotape ratings were used to determine the effect of the coadministration of these drugs.
 Ventricle-brain ratios derived from CT scans were used to predict response to the coadministration of these drugs.
 RESULTS: Amphetamine improved performance on a measure of concept formation on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test but did not result in changes in performance on tests of memory or attention.
 As a group, the patients were more active and performed psychomotor tests more quickly while receiving amphetamine.
 Six patients were judged by clinical raters to have improved in terms of affect, cooperation, and engagement with the environment.
 Improvement was associated with enlarged cerebral ventricles and increases in blink rate from the placebo to the active drug condition.
 No patient unequivocally worsened.
 CONCLUSIONS: These results may be consistent with the theory that coadministration of amphetamine and haloperidol produces relatively selective enhancement of cortical dopaminergic activity.
 However, because of the acute nature of the trial and the specialized research environment in which it was conducted, the authors do not advocate amphetamine as a routine clinical treatment of schizophrenia.

3828,"Intraoperative monitoring of the facial nerve during decompressive surgery for hemifacial spasm.
 In 11 consecutive patients, intraoperative electromyographic (EMG) recordings were made from the facial muscles during microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm.
 In one patient, recordings could not be obtained for technical reasons, and two patients had no abnormality.
 In the remaining eight patients, the abnormal response resolved before decompression in two, resolved immediately at the time of decompression in five, and failed to resolve in one.
 All patients were relieved of their hemifacial spasm.
 In the five patients whose abnormalities resolved at the time of decompression, there was a precise intraoperative correlation between decompression of the nerve and disappearance of the abnormal EMG response.
 In three cases, this was a useful guide to the need to decompress more than one vessel.
 These results confirm the findings of Moller and Jannetta, support the use of this technique for intraoperative monitoring of facial nerve decompression procedures, and provide strong circumstantial evidence that vascular cross-compression is an important etiological factor in hemifacial spasm.

3877,"Response of plasma endorphins, corticotropin, cortisol, and luteinizing hormone in the corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test in eumenorrheic and amenorrheic athletes.
 We compared pituitary response in the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) test between 9 eumenorrheic and 10 amenorrheic endurance athletes.
 The maximal oxygen capacity (VO2max), determined using an exercise test on a bicycle ergometer, was larger in amenorrheic (62.7 +/- 1.0 SE mL/min per kg) than in eumenorrheic (54.7 +/- 2.3 mL/min per kg) athletes.
 A 100 micrograms bolus of human CRH was administered intravenously, and blood samples were collected at -15, 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.
 The mean basal concentrations of endorphins, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol did not show significant differences between the groups.
 The cumulative response of ACTH in the CRH test was larger in eumenorrheic (7.7 +/- 1.3 pmol/L) than in amenorrheic (3.6 +/- 0.6 pmol/L) athletes, but the response of endorphins and cortisol did not differ between the groups.
 A negative correlation was found between the VO2max and the ACTH response during the CRH test in the total group of athletes.
 These findings indicated changes in the function of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in amenorrheic athletes that can be attributed to intensive training.

3696,"Childhood traumas: an outline and overview 
 Childhood psychic trauma appears to be a crucial etiological factor in the development of a number of serious disorders both in childhood and in adulthood.
 Like childhood rheumatic fever, psychic trauma sets a number of different problems into motion, any of which may lead to a definable mental condition.
 The author suggests four characteristics related to childhood trauma that appear to last for long periods of life, no matter what diagnosis the patient eventually receives.
 These are visualized or otherwise repeatedly perceived memories of the traumatic event, repetitive behaviors, trauma-specific fears, and changed attitudes about people, life, and the future.
 She divides childhood trauma into two basic types and defines the findings that can be used to characterize each of these types.
 Type I trauma includes full, detailed memories, ""omens,"" and misperceptions.
 Type II trauma includes denial and numbing, self-hypnosis and dissociation, and rage.
 Crossover conditions often occur after sudden, shocking deaths or accidents that leave children handicapped.
 In these instances, characteristics of both type I and type II childhood traumas exist side by side.
 There may be considerable sadness.
 Each finding of childhood trauma discussed by the author is illustrated with one or two case examples.

3694,"Quantification of leakage pressures after durotomy repairs in the canine.
 This study was undertaken to investigate the relative strengths of dural repair using standard suture techniques, suture supplemented with tissue adhesive, and tissue adhesive alone.
 Uniform 2 mm dural defects were created in adult beagles, repaired, and then subjected to pressurization testing.
 Defects repaired with suture alone initially leaked within the range of physiologic pressurization, while those supplemented with tissue adhesive or repaired with tissue adhesive alone failed at higher pressurization levels.
 Histologic sections obtained from the dura treated with fibrin adhesive sealant demonstrated minimal inflammatory response not significantly different than those sections examined at sites repaired by suture alone.
 A new substance, fibrin adhesive sealant, appears to be useful in effecting dural repair due to its ability to withstand pressures greater than those obtained with suture alone.

3717,"Ventilatory effect of acute pulmonary hypothermia.
 The isolated effect of cooling the pulmonary circulation on ventilation was quantified in nine anesthetized dogs.
 The right pulmonary artery (RPA) was cannulated within the pericardium, and systemic blood was pumped from the left atrium to the RPA between, but not during, periods of cooling.
 Cooled blood boluses were injected into the RPA under conditions in which either bolus temperature (5-35 degrees C) or volume (0-1.5 ml/kg body wt) varied.
 Inspiratory time (TI), expiratory time (TE), breath duration (TT), and peak integrated activity (PEAK) were determined from diaphragm EMG.
 Results for five postinjection breaths were converted to a percent of the values from five preinjection breaths.
 There was a linear relationship between bolus temperature and TI [r = 0.61, slope (x) = 0.59%/degrees C, P less than 0.001), TE (r = 0.73, x = 1.43%/degrees C, P less than 0.001] as well as TT (r = 0.74, x = 1.10%/degrees C, P less than 0.001), whereas PEAK was unaffected (n = 9).
 When injection temperature was 5 degrees C, an inverse linear relationship existed between bolus volume and TI (r = 0.75, x = -15.2%.ml-1.kg-1, P less than 0.001) and TE (r = 0.78, x = -23.4%.ml-1.kg-1, P less than 0.001) (n = 4).
 In two dogs tested the effect of bolus injection was minimal at residual volume and progressively increased with lung volume.
 The effect of cold bolus injection was eliminated after right vagotomy in three dogs.
 Results indicate that cooling of some vagal receptor in the lung increases breathing frequency primarily by shortening TE.

3938,"Enantiomers of oxybutynin: in vitro pharmacological characterization at M1, M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors and in vivo effects on urinary bladder contraction, mydriasis and salivary secretion in guinea pigs.
 The major side effects of racemic oxybutynin (OXY), which is used in the treatment of urinary incontinence are dry mouth (xerostomia) and blurred vision (mydriasis).
 Highly purified enantiomers of OXY [(R)OXY, (S)OXY] were compared with the racemate both in vitro in functional studies and in vivo in guinea pigs to evaluate their pharmacological action relative to their adverse effects.
 The affinity of (R)OXY and (S)OXY for different muscarinic receptor subtypes was determined using field stimulated rabbit vas deferens (M1) and guinea pig atria (M2) or bladder (M3) strips.
 Stereoselective antimuscarinic effects [(R)OXY greater than or equal to (R/S) OXY much greater than (S)OXY] were evident at all three receptor subtypes; the isomeric ratio [(S)OXY/(R)OXY] ranged from 12 to 88.
 Both (R)OXY and (R/S)OXY were slightly more selective (2-4-fold, P less than .01) for M1 and M3 relative to M2 muscarinic receptors.
 Stereoselectivity was also evident in vivo for volume-induced urinary bladder contractions as measured by cystometrogram parameters [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 21], mydriasis [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 136] and salivary gland secretory responses [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 30].
 The absolute potencies of (R)OXY or (R/S)OXY for mydriasis and salivation were similar to those for inhibition of intravesical bladder pressure.
 Also, (R)OXY and (R/S)OXY equipotently antagonized cholinergic-mediated CNS effects in mice.
 Collectively, the data suggest that the activity of (R/S)OXY resides predominantly in the (R)-enantiomer.
 However, it appears that (R)OXY may offer no significant pharmacological advantage over (R/S)OXY in terms of its principal therapeutic and side effect profile.

3714,"Polyamines and ornithine decarboxylase during repair of duodenal mucosa after stress in rats.
 This investigation shows whether polyamines and ornithine decarboxylase have a role in duodenal mucosal repair following stress-induced microscopic damage.
 Rats were fasted for 22 hours, placed in restraint cages, and immersed in water to the xiphoid process for 6 hours.
 Animals were killed either immediately after the period of stress or at 2-hour intervals up to 24 hours thereafter.
 Duodenal mucosa was examined histologically, and ornithine decarboxylase and polyamine levels were measured.
 Ornithine decarboxylase activity was increased significantly up to 6 hours following stress, peaking at 4 hours at a level 10 times the prestress control.
 By 8 hours, enzyme activity had returned to near normal.
 Increases in mucosal putrescine, spermidine, and spermine content paralleled the changes in ornithine decarboxylase activity and peaked 4 hours after stress.
 Stress resulted in microscopic damage evidenced by a nearly complete absence of villi.
 Significant macroscopic lesions were not present following stress.
 Mucosal repair was evident 12 hours after stress and almost complete by 24 hours, although the restituted villi were short and blunted.
 The decreases in mucosal DNA, RNA, and protein content caused by stress were restored and reached near-normal levels 12 hours after the period of stress.
 In animals given the specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, alpha-difluoromethylornithine, increases in duodenal mucosal ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine levels were inhibited and mucosal repair was almost completely prevented following stress.
 alpha-Difluoromethylornithine also prevented the recovery of DNA, RNA, and protein content of the duodenal mucosa.
 These results indicate that duodenal mucosal damage following stress is repaired rapidly; the repair process is accompanied by significant increases in ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine levels; and the increases in ornithine decarboxylase and polyamines are absolutely required for the normal repair of the mucosa.

 Immune functions, including cell surface markers, interleukin-2 receptor levels and responses of lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation were evaluated in seven growth hormone deficient children ages 4-15 years, during treatment with biosynthetically derived human growth hormone.
 Treatment resulted in a decrease in % B cells and in % T total cells and also decreases in most individual patients' mitogen responses and interleukin-2 receptor levels.
 Most of the changes noted were transient and similar to those previously demonstrated during pituitary-derived human growth hormone treatment.
 Although not resulting in overt clinical manifestations in our patients, we think that potential interactions between growth hormone and immune functions need to be considered by physicians treating children with growth hormone.

3817,"Development of a special care unit for chronically critically ill patients.
 Intensive care units (ICUs) are recognized as one of the most expensive services provided by hospitals.
 Within these ICUs are a growing population of patients whose stays are extensively prolonged because of complications or underlying chronic health conditions that are exacerbated by a critical illness.
 These patients can be described as ""chronically critically ill"" and are costly to hospitals both in terms of actual dollars and in terms of the burden of care to nurses and physicians.
 This article describes the creation of a special care unit (SCU) designed specifically to meet the needs of chronically critically ill patients.
 The SCU environment is composed of a physical design that accommodates limited technology and care aimed at family involvement and rehabilitation, a case management practice model, and a shared governance management model.
 This structure is in contrast to traditional ICU environments, which include physical layouts that allow for high technology and close monitoring of patients, a primary nursing delivery system, and a bureaucratic management model.
 A research project to compare the effects of the SCU with the effects of the traditional ICUs on nurse and patient outcomes is described.

3633,"Use of ektacytometry to determine red cell susceptibility to oxidative stress.
 To define a more sensitive and reliable method to determine changes in the overall cellular characteristics of erythrocytes after oxidative damage, we used a viscodiffractometric method (ektacytometry) to measure the effect of oxidative stress.
 Erythrocytes were incubated in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, or cumene hydroperoxide in phosphate buffer.
 This treatment resulted in decreased cellular deformability of the intact erythrocytes.
 In addition, deformability and fragility measurements of the erythrocyte ghost membranes indicated an increased membrane dynamic rigidity and altered-mechanical stability as a consequence of oxidant stress.
 These changes were observed before the onset of hemolysis.
 The observed decrease in deformability was accompanied by oxidation of hemoglobin, alterations of membrane proteins, and lipid peroxidation.
 To continuously measure the time course of the decrease in deformability in intact erythrocytes under oxidative stress, a new ektacytometric method was developed.
 Erythrocytes were oxidatively challenged within the viscometer at a constant osmolality and shear stress.
 The change in deformability was monitored and a typical range was defined for erythrocytes from normal individuals.
 Comparison of erythrocytes from patients with sickle cell disease with those from normal individuals demonstrated a higher susceptibility of sickle red cells toward oxidative stress.

3868,"Beneficial effect of upper thoracic epidural anesthesia in experimental hemorrhagic shock in dogs: influence of circulating catecholamines.
 The question as to whether reduction of plasma catecholamine concentration contributes to the beneficial effects of upper thoracic epidural anesthesia on survival during hemorrhagic shock was examined.
 Twenty-six dogs were anesthetized with halothane and nitrous oxide, and blood was withdrawn to reduce the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) to 40 mmHg.
 The 12 dogs in group A received both upper thoracic epidural anesthesia before the hemorrhage and intravenous infusion of epinephrine (450 ng.kg-1.min-1) and norepinephrine (150 ng.kg-1.min-1) during hemorrhage.
 The 14 dogs in group B received none of these.
 At 20 min after the start of the bleeding, plasma catecholamine concentrations were increased in both groups more than ten-fold.
 There were no significant intergroup differences with respect to these concentrations at any point during the experimental period.
 During the 100-min period of hemorrhage, 1 of the 12 animals in group A and 10 of the 14 in group B died.
 A significant difference in survival was seen between the two groups over the 100-min hypotensive period (P less than 0.01 by the generalized Wilcoxon test).
 These results suggest that the survival benefit of upper thoracic epidural anesthesia cannot be explained simply by differences in the level of catecholamines in the plasma, and that perhaps differences in the level of catecholamines at the nerve endings or other factors may be more important.

3889,"Cytokine release syndrome induced by the 145-2C11 anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody in mice: prevention by high doses of methylprednisolone.
 The hamster mAb 145-2C11 specific for the CD3 complex of murine T lymphocytes shares many properties with OKT3, including the induction of T cell activation.
 In vivo, the injection of 145-2C11 entails a variety of pathologic changes in relation to the systemic release of cytokines.
 We tested the effects on this cytokine release syndrome of different doses of methylprednisolone (m-PDS) given at various intervals of time before the 145-2C11 mAb.
 The administration of high doses of m-PDS (50 mg/kg) 2 to 3 h before the mAb resulted in an almost complete inhibition of the systemic release of TNF-alpha, IL-2, and IL-6.
 As far as the pathologic changes are concerned, the hypothermia, the acute renal tubular necrosis, and the fatty infiltration of the liver were completely prevented whereas the hypoglycemia was only partially attenuated.
 The protective effect of m-PDS on the toxicity of 145-2C11 was confirmed by the reduction of the mortality rate among galactosamine-sensitized mice.
 The inhibition of the release of cytokines by m-PDS did not affect the immunosuppression triggered by 145-2C11 as assessed by the CTL activity against alloantigens measured 48 h after the injection of the mAb.
 We conclude that the administration of very high doses of glucocorticoids 2 to 3 h before 145-2C11 prevents the release of cytokines and attenuates the acute toxicity of the mAb.
 Similar protocols could allow mitigation of the cytokine-release syndrome induced by the OKT3 mAb in man.

4029,"The value of routine preoperative laboratory testing in predicting postoperative complications: a multivariate analysis.
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of preoperative laboratory testing to predict postoperative complications.
 Five hundred twenty patients undergoing elective surgery had their American Society of Anesthesiologists' classification, ponderal index, electrolyte values, glucose levels, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine values, complete blood counts, coagulation studies, total protein/albumin/lymphocyte count, electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, urinalysis, pulmonary function tests, type of anesthesia, and type of operation recorded preoperatively.
 Patients were followed prospectively after surgery for the development of complications.
 The data were analyzed by univariate and multivariate methods.
 Postoperative complications were strongly associated with American Society of Anesthesiologists' classification, type of anesthesia, and type of operation.
 However, only a few laboratory tests, such as electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, and nutritional status, were associated with postoperative complications.
 Therefore, in general, preoperative laboratory testing should only be undertaken for specific indications.
 Recommendations for routine tests are made depending on the age of the patient.

3885,"Screening of nineteen unrelated families with generalized resistance to thyroid hormone for known point mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene and the detection of a new mutation.
 Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH) is a syndrome characterized by impaired tissue responsiveness to thyroid hormone.
 Two distinct point mutations in the hormone binding domain of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta have recently been identified in two unrelated families with GRTH.
 One, Mf, involves a replacement of the normal glycine-345 for arginine in exon 7 and another, Mh, replaces the normal proline-453 for histidine in exon 8.
 To probe for the presence of the Mf and Mh defect in 19 unrelated families with GRTH, we applied separate polymerase chain reactions using allele-specific oligonucleotide primers containing the normal and each of the two mutant nucleotides at the 3'-position.
 A total of 24 affected subjects and 13 normal family members were studied.
 The mode of inheritance was dominant in 13 families, was unknown in 5 families, and was clearly recessive in 1 family in which only the consanguineous subjects were affected.
 Primers containing the substitutions specific for Mf and Mh amplified exons 7 and 8, respectively, only in affected members of each of the two index families.
 Primers containing the normal sequences amplified exons 7 and 8 of the TR beta gene in all subjects except affected members of one family.
 In this family with recessively inherited GRTH, neither exon could be amplified using any combinations of primers and DNA blot revealed absence of all coding exons.
 These results indicate a major deletion of the TR beta gene, including both DNA and hormone binding domains.
 Since heterozygous members of this family are not affected, the presence of a single normal allele is sufficient for normal function of the TR beta.
 These data also support the hypothesis that in the dominant mode of GRTH inheritance the presence of an abnormal TR beta interferes with the function of the normal TR beta.
 Distinct mutations are probably responsible for GRTH in unrelated families.

3905,"Molecular basis of the activation of the tumorigenic potential of Gag-insulin receptor chimeras.
 A previous study showed that the human insulin receptor (IR) could be activated by insertion of a 3' portion of the cDNA encoding the beta subunit into a retrovirus genome to form a Gag-IR fusion protein.
 While capable of transforming cells in culture, this IR cDNA-containing virus, called UIR, was not able to induce tumors in animals.
 Subsequently, we isolated a spontaneous sarcomagenic variant called UIR19t from the parental UIR.
 UIR19t was molecularly cloned, sequenced, and found to harbor two mutations.
 A 44-amino acid deletion immediately upstream from the transmembrane domain of the Gag-IR fusion protein removes all the extracellular sequence of the IR remaining in the original UIR construct.
 In addition, a single nucleotide deletion at the 3' end results in truncation and replacement of the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acids by 4 new amino acids.
 The specific kinase activity of UIR19t is 4- to 5-fold higher than that of the parental UIR.
 However, no new cellular substrates were detected in UIR19t-transformed cells as compared to UIR cells.
 Viruses containing either the 5' or the 3' deletion mutation were constructed and assessed for their biological function.
 Our data indicate that the 5' deletion alone is sufficient to confer tumorigenic ability.
 We conclude that sequence immediately upstream from the transmembrane domain imposes a negative effect on the transforming and tumorigenic potential of the Gag-IR fusion protein.

3820,"Regional H2O2 concentration in rat brain after hyperoxic convulsions.
 O2 toxicity of the central nervous system (CNS) may be a result of enhanced generation of reactive O2 species such as superoxide and H2O2 at high PO2.
 In this study, we measured H2O2 production in six regions of the rat brain before and after convulsions induced by hyperbaric hyperoxia (HBO).
 H2O2 concentration was determined ex vivo using a method based on the H2O2-dependent decline in catalase activity in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor of compound I, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole.
 Regional catalase activity in the brain ranged from 0.029 +/- 0.004 to 0.055 +/- 0.004 mumol O2.min-1.micrograms DNA-1 in cerebellum and medulla-pons, respectively.
 In the presence of aminotriazole, catalase activity declined after HBO-induced convulsions to 26-45% of normoxic values.
 The rates of inactivation of catalase were used to predict average steady-state values for H2O2 concentration in different brain structures.
 Estimated H2O2 concentrations during HBO varied from 31 to 51 pM in cerebellum and posterior subcortex and represented increases of 2.2-7.3 times normoxic values.
 These findings suggest that H2O2 is an important mediator of selective neuronal vulnerability to CNS O2 toxicity.

3849,"Oxygen debt and metabolic acidemia as quantitative predictors of mortality and the severity of the ischemic insult in hemorrhagic shock.
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS: An experimental canine model of hemorrhagic, hypovolemic shock is described that uses oxygen debt and its metabolic consequences of lactic acidemia and metabolic base deficit as independent variables for the prediction of probability of death.
 RESULTS: Lactic acidemia and metabolic base deficit are compared with the conventional hemodynamic variables of BP and cardiac output (Qt) as predictors of outcome and are shown to be superior using a modified Kaplan-Meier probability statistic.
 The LD50 for oxygen debt is shown to be 113.5 mL/kg, 12.9 mmol/L for lactate, and -18.8 mmol/L for base excess (BE).
 Comparison is made between the ability of Qt, BP, shed blood, BE, and lactate to predict oxygen debt.
 CONCLUSIONS: Of the single-variable predictors, BE shows the highest explained variability.
 However, a combined prediction from both lactate and BE appears superior to the use of either alone.
 Using this regression to compute the oxygen debt, it is possible to estimate accurately the actual level of oxygen debt from the BE and lactate values obtained during hemorrhagic hypovolemia.
 From serial determinations over time of the increase in these biochemical variables above the oxygen debt baseline, it is possible to estimate the rate of oxygen debt accumulation and the time remaining until the LD50 will be reached as indicators of the severity of the total body ischemia resulting from hemorrhagic shock.

3679,"Interpleural analgesia after thoracotomy.
 We examined the effects of the following variables on interpleural analgesia after thoracotomy: addition of epinephrine to local anesthetic, thoracostomy drainage, two-catheter placement, and location of catheter tips.
 Twenty patients were randomized to have one catheter (paravertebral tip location) or two catheters (paravertebral and lateral thoracic wall tip locations).
 Interpleural catheters were sutured to the parietal pleura by the surgeon at time of wound closure.
 Patients were then randomly assigned to receive 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine through the single catheter or 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with or without 1:200,000 epinephrine through each of the two catheters while supine.
 Bupivacaine concentrations in whole blood and in thoracostomy drainage fluid were assayed by gas chromatography.
 Actual content of bupivacaine in the drainage fluid was calculated.
 Degree of analgesia was assessed by verbal numerical pain scores over the first 4 h and opioid demand thereafter.
 Addition of epinephrine to bupivacaine did not influence the degree of analgesia.
 Approximately 30%-40% of any administered dose of bupivacaine was lost via the thoracostomy tube over a 4-h period.
 There was no correlation between the true initial dose (100 mg minus thoracostomy drainage) and Cmax.
 Use of two catheters resulted in significantly less opioid requirements after an initial 8-h period.
 Failure to achieve adequate interpleural analgesia in postthoracotomy patients may be related to loss of anesthetic via thoracostomy drainage, presence of extravasated blood and tissue fluid in the pleural space, and possibly sequestration and channeling of flow of local anesthetic by restricted motion of an operated lung.

3728,"Application of pulsed and continuous wave 1.32 and 1.06 microns wavelengths of the Nd:YAG laser in the canine tracheobronchial tree: a comparative study.
 Previous investigations have shown good clinical potential for the use of the 1.32 microns wavelength Nd:YAG laser because its soft tissue absorption is better than that of the 1.06 microns wavelength Nd:YAG laser.
 The 1.32 microns wavelength Nd:YAG laser has an absorption coefficient in water that is 10 times higher than the 1.06 microns wavelength Nd:YAG laser.
 A comparative in vivo study of laser soft tissue effects was performed by using the 1.32 microns wavelength and the 1.06 microns wavelength Nd:YAG lasers in a pulsed wave (PW) mode and continuous wave (CW) mode using a non-contact endoscopic delivery system.
 A standard 5 mm mucosal lesion was made in the canine tracheobronchial tree down to the level of the perichondrium.
 Soft tissue and cartilage effects were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy, acutely, 1 week and 2 weeks after operation, and a comparison was made between the different laser modalities.
 To create similar lesions, higher energy was required when using the 1.06 microns wavelength Nd:YAG laser.
 Soft tissue injury was greater with the 1.06 microns wavelength in CW mode, and no cartilage damage occurred in the PW mode.
 Soft tissue and cartilage repair after 1 and 2 weeks was better with the 1.32 microns wavelength laser.
 In comparison, the CO2 laser and the contact Nd:YAG laser proved to be more precise cutting tools than the 1.32 microns wavelength or the 1.06 microns wavelength Nd:YAG lasers.
 Both Nd:YAG laser wavelengths were useful for coagulation and vaporization of tissues and blood vessels.

3680,"A blinded comparison of noninvasive, in vivo phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the in vitro halothane/caffeine contracture test in the evaluation of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility.
 Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially fatal, anesthetic-induced syndrome.
 Currently, the only accurate means of diagnosing susceptibility to this syndrome is the testing of biopsied skeletal muscle for its contracture response to halothane and caffeine.
 A less invasive means of diagnosis is needed.
 The authors previously reported that MH-susceptible patients studied by in vivo phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) spectroscopy demonstrated a higher resting inorganic phosphate (Pi) to phosphocreatine (PCr) ratio in their skeletal muscle, as well as a slower postexercise recovery of PCr/Pi, when compared to normal controls.
 In the present blinded study, the authors compared in vivo 31P NMR determination of resting Pi/PCr and recovery rate of PCr/Pi in forearm muscles to in vitro halothane/caffeine contracture test results in 42 patients.
 Forty-three control subjects were studied to establish normal NMR values of resting Pi/PCr and recovery rate of PCr/Pi.
 Their findings were compared with those of 27 patients shown to be MH-susceptible and 15 patients MH-negative by contracture testing.
 The MH-susceptible group had a significantly (P less than 0.005) higher resting Pi/PCr value (0.202 +/- 0.044) than either the MH-negative (0.152 +/- 0.043) or the control (0.141 +/- 0.026) group.
 The MH-susceptible group also had a significantly (P less than 0.02) slower postexercise recovery rate of PCr/Pi (1.50 +/- 0.872 PCr.Pi-1.min-1) than either the MH-negative (2.11 +/- 1.07 PCr.Pi-1.min-1) or control (2.25 +/- 0.828 PCr.Pi-1.min-1) group.
 Twenty-six of the 27 MH-susceptible patients demonstrated abnormal NMR test results (a resting Pi/PCr greater than or equal to 0.18 or recovery rate less than 1.0 PCr.Pi-1.min-1), and 13 of the 15 MH-negative patients had normal NMR results.
 Although neither NMR parameter alone was diagnostically reliable, an NMR test utilizing both parameters was quite accurate.
 The NMR test and contracture test demonstrated an overall agreement of 93% with a copositivity of 96% and conegativity of 87%.
 The sensitivity and specificity of the NMR test is estimated to be 98.8% +/- 11.8% and 95.3% +/- 20.3%, respectively.
 The role of 31P NMR in the diagnosis of MH susceptibility and possible mechanisms underlying the observations are discussed.

3920,"Toxicities in rats with free versus liposomal encapsulated cisplatin.
 Wistar rats (five in each group) were given either 1 mg/kg of free cisplatin, 1 or 2 mg/kg of liposomal encapsulated cisplatin, or saline solution intraperitoneally biweekly for 15 injections.
 Rats in the free drug group showed significantly less weight gain; two rats died during the study.
 At necropsy, the free cisplatin--treated rats showed gross and microscopic evidence of peritoneal fibrosis that was not detected in any of the remaining groups.
 The free cisplatin--treated rats showed serum and histologic evidence of renal damage; all five rats had moderate or severe acute tubular necrosis.
 No renal abnormalities were detected in rats that received 1 mg/kg, and only focal or mild changes were found in rats that received 2 mg/kg of the liposomal preparation.
 Neurotoxicity, as determined by nerve conduction and inclined plane studies, developed in rats treated with free and liposomal cisplatin.
 These results are encouraging and warrant further investigation.

3740,"Perinatal grief and mourning.
 The grief and mourning that parents experience following a perinatal loss is as devastating as the loss of an older loved one.
 The pattern of mourning can be anticipated and interventions can be implemented.
 With proper help, the parents can pass through this catastrophic time in their lives with a minimum of scars.
 If the physician stops, reaches out, listens, and supports the parents, he or she can have a dramatic effect on the lives of these parents.
 In the same manner in which we started this paper, we close with a quotation from another parent who suffered a loss: Daughters may die, But why? For even daughters can't live with half a heart.
 Three days isn't much a life.
 But long enough to remember thin blue lips, uneven gasps in incubators, Racking breaths that cause a pain to those who watched.
 Long enough to remember I never held her Or felt her softness Or counted her toes.
 I didn't even know the color of her eyes.
 Dead paled hands not quite covered by the gown she Was to go home in.
 Moist earth smell.
 One small casket.
 And the tears.

 But you can't know because I don't feel.

3703,"Quadriceps myopathy: forme fruste of Becker muscular dystrophy.
 We examined dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene, in muscle biopsy specimens from 4 male patients with quadriceps myopathy, all of whom showed a mild and slowly progressive myopathy confined to the quadriceps muscles.
 All 4 patients had clear abnormalities of dystrophin, and were diagnosed as having Becker muscular dystrophy by both immunofluorescence and immunoblot examinations; that is, dystrophin of an abnormal molecular mass was visualized in muscle cryosections as ""patchy"" or discontinuous immunostaining at the surface membrane of the muscle fibers.
 One patient had a brother who showed widespread myopathic changes consistent with typical Becker muscular dystrophy.
 We conclude that the syndrome called quadriceps myopathy includes a group of forme fruste Becker muscular dystrophy.

4035,"Hairless micropig skin. A novel model for studies of cutaneous biology.
 Reported here is the structural and immunohistochemical similarities between the Yucatan hairless micropig (HMP) skin and that of humans.
 Hairless micropig skin surface was composed of complex intersecting furrows that created geometric patterns remarkably similar to human skin surface glyphics.
 The dermal--epidermal interface consisted of undulant downgrowths that interdigitated with dermal papillae.
 Hairless micropig epidermis contained two morphologically distinct populations of basal keratinocytes (serrated and nonserrated).
 Similar heterogeneity has been seen only in human epidermis and primate palmar epidermis.
 Immunohistochemistry revealed that the HMP epidermis is reactive with monoclonal and polyclonal antisera to keratin proteins.
 Melanocytes reactive with antisera to S-100 protein, as in human skin, also were observed in HMP epidermis.
 Organization of dermal extracellular matrix, including collagen and elastic fibers, and the organization and reactivity of the microvasculature with antisera to factor VIII, were consistent with human skin.
 The costicosteroid-induced atrophy and subsequent rebound phenomenon after withdrawal of steroid observed in HMP skin was similar with that observed in humans.
 It is concluded that HMP skin approximates human skin significantly more precisely than most existing species and is an excellent model for studies of cutaneous physiology and pharmacology.

3772,"Nerve growth factor binding domain of the nerve growth factor receptor.
 A structural analysis of the rat low-affinity nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor was undertaken to define the NGF binding domain.
 Mutant NGF receptor DNA constructs were expressed in mouse fibroblasts or COS cells, and the ability of the mutant receptor to bind NGF was assayed.
 In the first mutant, all but 16 amino acid residues of the intracellular domain of the receptor were removed.
 This receptor bound NGF with a Kd comparable to that of the wild-type receptor.
 A second mutant contained only the four cysteine-rich sequences from the extracellular portion of the protein.
 This mutant was expressed in COS cells and the resultant protein was a secreted soluble form of the receptor that was able to bind NGF.
 Two N-terminal deletions, in which either the first cysteine-rich sequence of the first and part of the second cysteine-rich sequences were removed, bound NGF.
 However, a mutant lacking all four cysteine-rich sequences was unable to bind NGF.
 These results show that the four cysteine-rich sequences of the NGF receptor contain the NGF binding domain.

3804,"Increased microvascular permeability in vivo in response to intradermal injection of neutrophil-activating protein (NAP-2) in rabbit skin.
 Neutrophil-activating protein-2 (NAP-2), an NH2-terminally processed form of the platelet-release product beta thromboglobulin (beta TG), was purified to homogeneity from stimulated human blood leukocytes.
 In the presence of a vasodilator substance (PGE2, CGRP) picomolar (pmol/l) amounts of NAP-2 induced neutrophil accumulation and plasma leakage on intradermal injection in rabbit skin, whereas the longer forms, beta TG itself and connective tissue-activating peptide III (CTAP-III), had no such effect.
 NAP-2-induced increased in microvascular permeability was neutrophil dependent and fast in onset, with a half-life of 65 to 75 minutes, comparable to that previously reported for the structural-related neutrophil-activating protein-1/interleukin-8 (NAP-1/IL-8).
 However NAP-2 showed a lower potency in that more protein was needed to provoke skin reactivity.
 Nevertheless the finding that a platelet release product can elicit neutrophil-mediated inflammation further narrows the gap between thrombotic events and inflammatory disorders.

4034,"Isotonic high-sodium oral rehydration solution for increasing sodium absorption in patients with short-bowel syndrome.
 We compared the effect of a standard oral rehydration solution and a high-sodium polymeric-glucose solution on sodium absorption in short-bowel syndrome.
 Six patients with high jejunostomy were tested in a random order with the standard solution or a solution containing maltodextrins (18 g Glucidex 12/L) enriched with 2.5 g NaCl/L.
 Solutions were administered via a nasogastric tube at a rate of 2 mL/min.
 Jejunal effluent was collected during an 8-h period.
 The net 8-h fluid absorption was not significantly different in the two periods.
 Glucose absorption was greater than 90% of the administered amount for both solutions.
 Net sodium absorption was greater for the maltodextrin solution than for the standard solution (56 +/- 12 vs 24 +/- 20 mmol, P less than 0.05).
 We conclude that replacement of glucose with maltodextrins and addition of sodium in the standard oral rehydration solution results in improved sodium absorption in short-bowel syndrome.

3718,"The validity of canine platelet aggregometry in predicting vascular graft patency.
 Several laboratories have found canine platelet aggregometry predictive of thrombotic potential in vascular grafts.
 Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is a frequently used agonist, often at unspecified or differing concentrations.
 This study was designed to evaluate the predictive value of ADP-induced platelet aggregometry and the validity of the methodology.
 Platelet aggregometry in response to 2 x 10(-5) M ADP was assayed in 70 dogs.
 Twenty-six percent were aggregators, 51% were non-aggregators, and 20% were indeterminant.
 All dogs were then treated with aspirin and dipyridamole.
 Vascular prostheses were implanted bilaterally (aorto-iliac) and anti-platelet therapy continued for two weeks.
 Dose-response to ADP was studied at three concentrations in 20 dogs.
 At 2 x 10(-5) 1/20 aggregated, at 4 x 10(-5) 3/19 aggregated and at 2 x 10(-4) 15/20 aggregated.
 Time between samples and study was evaluated in 11 dogs, with 2/11 changing from non-aggregator to aggregator at two or three hours.
 Daily reproducibility was studied in 70 dogs, 14 of which changed aggregation status between days.
 Patency was 58/68 (85%) for non-aggregators, 23/34 (68%) for aggregators (p = 0.038).
 Platelet aggregometry has significant predictive value for graft patency but methodology must be specified and standardized.

3663,"Retro-orbicularis oculus fat (ROOF) resection in aesthetic blepharoplasty: a 6-year study in 63 patients 
 Sixty-three nonconsecutive patients have undergone resection of the retro-orbicularis oculus fat (ROOF) in conjunction with aesthetic blepharoplasty.
 In these patients, a consistent and useful ability to soften and flatten heaviness and bulkiness in the lateral upper orbital region was seen.
 Two patients developed postoperative hematoma, and two different patients had transient dry-eye symptoms following blepharoplasty.
 Twenty percent of patients had a transient degree of numbness in the lateral supraorbital nerve region, and all patients noted some transient numbness over the lateral upper brow region.
 No patient demonstrated significant paralysis of the orbicularis oculus or corrugator muscle.
 From this experience, retro-orbicularis oculus fat resection would appear to be a useful adjunct to standard blepharoplasty techniques in selected patients.

3789,"Patients in a persistent vegetative state attitudes and reactions of family members.
 Patients in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) constituted approximately 3% of the population in four Milwaukee nursing homes.
 In order to understand family members' attitudes and reactions toward such patients, 33 (92%) of 36 family members of patients in PVS contacted were studied.
 The age of the patients ranged from 19 to 95 with a mean age of 73.4 +/- 17.2 years, and family members' ages ranged from 41 to 89 with a mean age of 61.8 +/- 3.3 years.
 The etiology of the PVS varied from dementia to cerebral trauma.
 The mean duration of the PVS was 54 +/- 8.4 months (range 12 to 204).
 Family members reported that they visited patients 260 times during the first year following the onset of the PVS and were still visiting at a rate of 209 visits yearly at the time of the interview.
 There was no significant correlation between the frequency of the family members visits and the duration of the PVS, the patient's or family member's age, or the family member's relationship to the patient.
 Ninety percent of patients were considered by family members to have some awareness of pain, light or darkness, environment, taste, verbal conversation, or the family member's presence.
 Most family members thought they understood the patient's medical condition, and the majority did not expect the patient to improve.
 Nevertheless, the majority of family members wanted the patient to undergo therapeutic interventions, including transfer to the acute hospital and surgery.

3699,"Comparison of rectal, axillary, and tympanic membrane temperatures in infants and young children.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the reliability of a tympanic membrane thermometer in detecting fever in young children presenting to the emergency department.
 SETTING: Pediatric emergency department in an urban teaching hospital, DESIGN/MEASUREMENT/PARTICIPANTS: Temperature measurements were obtained sequentially at three body sites in children less than 3 years old presenting to the pediatric ED.
 Axillary and rectal temperatures were obtained with an electronic thermistor probe (Diatek 500), and tympanic membrane temperatures were obtained with a noncontact, infrared sensing device (First TEMP).
 Patients were stratified by age, ear canal patency, presence of otitis media, and rectal temperature.
 RESULTS: Of 224 patients enrolled, 87 (39%) were febrile.
 Overall correlation of axillary and tympanic membrane measurements to rectal for all strata was .75 (P = .001) and .81 (P = .001), respectively.
 Sensitivity in detecting fever for axillary and tympanic membrane sites was .48 and .55, respectively.
 Otitis media and ear patency did not influence correlation of tympanic membrane measurements.
 Low tympanic membrane temperature sensitivity may be a result of probe configuration.
 CONCLUSION: Tympanic membrane and axillary temperatures should be viewed with caution in children less than 3 years old as neither can detect fever reliably.
