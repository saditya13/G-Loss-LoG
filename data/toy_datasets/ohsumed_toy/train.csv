34,"A clinical trial of topical terbinafine (a new allylamine antifungal) in the treatment of tinea pedis.
 Twenty-three patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial of terbinafine 1% cream compared with placebo vehicle in the treatment of tinea pedis.
 Of the 20 patients who were evaluated for efficacy, 10 received terbinafine and 10 received placebo.
 Except for the terbinafine-treated patients being an average of 11 years older than the patients receiving placebo and the median duration of disease being 6 weeks longer in the placebo group, the two groups were demographically and clinically similar.
 Results of mycologic tests and clinical findings showed terbinafine to be significantly more effective than placebo in the treatment of tinea pedis.
 Significantly more terbinafine-treated patients than placebo-treated patients showed conversion to negative culture and microscopy at end of therapy and a significant reduction in scored signs and symptoms.
 Overall efficacy at follow-up (combined mycologic and clinical findings) was also significantly greater in the terbinafine group (78%) than in the placebo group (zero) (p less than 0.001).
 Unexplained elevation of liver function test results was noted in three placebo-treated patients and in one terbinafine-treated patient, but these changes were not considered clinically relevant or drug related.

11,"Individualizing treatment of vaginal candidiasis.
 Clinicians have a vast array of effective antimycotics for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis.
 Multiple topical formulations are available, yet there is little evidence to suggest that formulation per se influences outcome.
 A growing number of highly effective oral systemic antimycotic agents provide the practitioner with additional options.
 Treatment regimens have also changed with the introduction of shorter, often single-day/single-dose courses of therapy.
 Not all therapeutic agents have the same activity against vaginal fungal pathogens in that topical azoles tend to be more active than nystatin.
 Differences in patient characteristics, however, are more important than the differences between antimycotic agents and therapeutic regimens in determining selection of the appropriate antimycotic.
 Patients with vaginal candidiasis vary with regard to duration and severity of symptoms and past frequency of attacks, distribution of inflammation, and pregnancy status.
 The clinician should consider all these variables both in selecting the appropriate antimycotic agent and the route of administration and in planning the duration of therapy.
 Individualized therapy offers additional benefits to patients, who may then enjoy the maximum advantages of antimycotics now available.

9,"Itraconazole in common dermatophyte infections of the skin: fixed treatment schedules.
 Itraconazole is an effective medication against the most common dermatophytoses.
 It has been shown to be more active than griseofulvin and ketoconazole.
 Ease of use, affinity for keratinized tissues, lack of toxicity, continued activity after discontinuation, and the possibility of using fixed schedules are advantages of itraconazole.
 The fixed schedules indicated by pharmacokinetics and clinical studies are one 100 mg capsule daily for 15 days in cases of tinea corporis and tinea cruris and the same dosage for 30 days in cases of tinea pedis and tinea manuum.
 These fixed treatments have some limitations, and they are not recommended for treating tinea capitis and tinea unguium.
 The drug is well tolerated.

21,"In vitro evaluation of nicotinamide riboside analogs against Haemophilus influenzae.
 Exogenous NAD, nicotinamide mononucleotide, or nicotinamide riboside is required for the growth of Haemophilus influenzae.
 These compounds have been defined as the V-factor growth requirement.
 We have previously shown that the internalization of nicotinamide riboside is energy dependent and carrier mediated with saturation kinetics.
 Thionicotinamide riboside, 3-pyridinealdehyde riboside, 3-acetylpyridine riboside, and 3-aminopyridine riboside were prepared from their corresponding NAD analogs.
 These compounds and several other nicotinamide riboside analogs were evaluated for their ability to support the growth of H.
 influenzae and for their ability to block the uptake of [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide riboside by H.
 influenzae.
 3-Aminopyridine riboside blocked the uptake of [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide riboside and inhibited the growth of H.
 influenzae when NAD, nicotinamide mononucleotide, or nicotinamide riboside served as the V factor.
 The antibacterial activity of 3-aminopyridine riboside was found to be specific for H.
 influenzae but had no effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli.
 In additional experiments by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, it was determined that whole cells of H.
 influenzae degrade 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide to 3-aminopyridine riboside, which is then internalized.
 Inside the cell, 3-aminopyridine riboside has the ability to interfere with the growth of H.
 influenzae by an undetermined mechanism.

55,"Limited efficacy of a Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine in Alaska Native infants. The Alaska H. influenzae Vaccine Study Group 
 BACKGROUND.
 The prevention of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease requires a vaccine that is effective when administered during the first six months of life.
 The infants of Alaska Natives are at particularly high risk of invasive H.
 influenzae type b disease.
 METHODS.
 To evaluate the protective efficacy of a H.
 influenzae type b polysaccharide-diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine (polyribosylribitol phosphate-diphtheria toxoid [PRP-D]), we enrolled 2102 Alaska Native infants in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which either the vaccine or a saline placebo was administered at approximately two, four, and six months of age.
 RESULTS.
 After 3969 subject-years of follow-up and 32 episodes of H.
 influenzae type b disease, the overall incidence of invasive disease was not reduced significantly in the vaccinated subjects (6.0 cases per 1000 patient-years), as compared with the placebo controls (9.6) or with other Alaska Native infants (6.0).
 After one, two, or three doses there was no significant protective efficacy with the vaccine; after three doses the efficacy was only 35 percent (95 percent confidence interval, -57 to 73).
 The lack of efficacy was not related to the age at onset of disease, age at immunization, type of disease, degree of Alaska Native heritage, time after immunization, or year of the study.
 Levels of H.
 influenzae type b anticapsular antibody in recipients of the vaccine became significantly higher than levels in those who received placebo only after the second and third doses.
 Even after the third dose, only 48 percent of the vaccinated infants had antibody levels of more than 0.1 microgram per milliliter (geometric mean titer, 0.18).
 Antibody responses did not vary with the level of maternally acquired antibody, degree of Alaska Native ancestry, or age at time of the first or second immunizations, but they increased with increasing age at time of the third dose (P less than 0.001).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 We found no evidence that the PRP-D vaccine provides significant protection, at least for Alaska Native infants, against invasive diseases caused by H.
 influenzae type b.
 The ineffectiveness of the vaccine paralleled its limited immunogenicity.

82,"Postneonatal mortality in Norway: a study of recent trends and comparison with other mortality rates in Norwegian children.
 Postneonatal mortality in Norway decreased rapidly from 1956 to 1980 but subsequently remained stable.
 In recent years the postneonatal death rate appears to be increasing, primarily due to greater numbers of deaths attributed to the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.
 During the same period, mortality among older children has also decreased, with the decline evident in all leading causes.
 Only among people aged 15 to 19 years have recent trends been less than encouraging, with the number of fatal traffic accidents in particular remaining stable or increasing.
 Although there is room for continued improvement, the widely held belief that the health status of Norwegian children is good is supported by the trends in mortality.

81,"Postneonatal infectious disease mortality: the French situation.
 Mortality caused by infectious and parasitic diseases represents a limited part of all postneonatal deaths in France, which have been stable for the past decade.
 This component is worthy of careful analysis because it is at least partially preventable.
 Statistics are presented and interpreted, with discussion on which disorders should be included in assessing the impact of infection on morbidity and mortality.
 Figures and international rankings change according to the inclusiveness of the definition chosen.
 There is need for epidemiologic and statistical research to make comparisons of mortality more clear.
 Morbidity is also important because of high incidence, frequent hospitalization, and a heavy social cost.
 Policy and services in France that relate to control and treatment of infection are described, as are shortcomings that call for further efforts.

61,"Comparison of species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of aerobic actinomycetes from clinical specimens.
 To compare the species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of aerobic actinomycetes, we evaluated 366 isolates referred to the Centers for Disease Control from October 1985 through February 1988.
 We used conventional biochemical tests to identify the various species.
 Four species accounted for 191 (52%) of aerobic actinomycete isolates: Nocardia asteroides (98 isolates), Actinomadura madurae (42 isolates), Streptomyces griseus (28 isolates), and Nocardia brasiliensis (23 isolates).
 Sputum and wounds were the most common sources.
 No isolate was resistant to amikacin, no N.
 brasiliensis isolate was resistant to sulfamethoxazole or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and no A.
 madurae isolate was resistant to ceftriaxone or imipenem.
 In summary, our findings show that unusual species of aerobic actinomycetes can cause infection, colonization, or both and that antimicrobial resistance varies markedly by species.

92,"Lack of association between medication use and the presence or absence of bacteriuria in elderly women.
 This study was undertaken to determine if there is an association between medication use and the presence or absence of bacteriuria in elderly ambulatory women.
 Of 198 women who participated in three urine culture surveys (every 6 months) during the 18-month study period, 66 (34.4%) had bacteriuria on at least one survey.
 Both univariate and multivariate analyses for the demographics, age, place of residence, and medication use (by drug class) revealed that only place of residence had a significant association with the presence or absence of bacteriuria.
 In this regard, bacteriuric subjects more commonly resided in the nursing home and less commonly lived in the apartment-house complex compared with nonbacteriuric subjects (P less than .05).
 Therefore, this study demonstrates that in elderly ambulatory women, medication use does not appear to be associated with the presence or absence of bacteriuria.

67,"Percutaneous central venous catheterization. Three years' experience in a neonatal intensive care unit.
 Prolonged venous access is desirable in very-low-birth-weight infants and infants for whom feedings are contraindicated.
 We prospectively evaluated 481 small-diameter venous catheters placed percutaneously in 317 patients over 3 years.
 Of 478 catheters, 241 (50%) were placed in infants weighing 1 kg or less.
 Mean catheter stay was 13 days (range, less than 1 to 77 days).
 Almost half (49%) of the central and thoracic catheters (91% of placements) were removed nonelectively: 43% due to problems such as leaking or clotting and 6% to suspicion of sepsis or venous occlusion.
 Of the 23 episodes of possible sepsis in the 478 catheter stays, six (1.3%) were confirmed catheter-related sepsis; 12 (2.5%) were confirmed alternate locus sepsis.
 Three factors specific to percutaneous central venous catheter-related sepsis were prolonged catheter stay (3 to 5 weeks), Staphylococcus epidermidis, and weight less than or equal to 1 kg.
 Four factors specific to alternate locus sepsis were presence of an alternate infection site, earlier infection (1 to 2 weeks), extremely low birth weight, and prolonged clinical instability.
 Percutaneous central venous catheterizations reduced the need for the stress of repeated venipuncture, resulting in lower complication rates than those reported with surgically placed central venous catheters, and leading to identification of risk factors specific to catheter sepsis and alternate locus sepsis.

114,"Suppression of herpes simplex virus type 1 reactivation from latency by (+-)-9-([(Z)-2-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexyl]methyl) guanine (L-653,180) in vitro.
 Latent herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection was induced in human embryonic lung cells in vitro by using a combination of viral replication inhibitors and elevated temperature.
 Under reactivating conditions (superinfection by human cytomegalovirus or temperature manipulation), a nonantiviral thymidine kinase inhibitor (L-653,180) was found to suppress or delay reactivation of HSV-1 from latently infected human embryonic lung cells.
 L-653,180 alone or in combination with interferon was ineffective as a primary or acute viral replication inhibitor and was unable to induce latent HSV-1 infection in cell culture.
 These data suggest that initial or acute virus replication and replication resulting from reactivation from latency are separate events.

131,"Are stressful life events risk factors for herpes zoster?
 To determine if psychologically stressful life events are risk factors for herpes zoster, we conducted a case-control study of zoster and self-reported recent negative life events and major changes in spousal relationships.
 The subjects were 101 healthy community-dwelling cases of zoster and 101 healthy controls matched for age, sex, and race and generated by random digit dialing.
 The Geriatric Scale of Recent Life Events was administered to case and control subjects, and additional questions were asked regarding the perception of the life event.
 The results showed that case subjects experienced negative life events significantly more often than subjects in the control groups in the 2 months before zoster onset by analysis of discordant pairs (26 versus 10, odds ratio 2.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13, 6.27, P = .012), 3 months before (29 versus 11, odds ratio 2.64, 95% CI 1.20, 6.04, P = .007), or 6 months before (35 versus 16, odds ratio 2.00, 95% CI 1.04, 3.93, P = .012).
 The mean number of total life events was significantly higher in cases at 6 months before zoster (case means = 2.64, control means = 1.82, P = .008), but there were no significant differences at 2, 3, or 12 months before.
 There were no significant differences between case subjects and control subjects for spousal events, or any given single life event.
 In conclusion, we found that whereas patients with herpes zoster experienced the same kinds of life events in the year preceding the illness as did control subjects, recent events perceived as stressful were significantly more common among patients with zoster.

143,"Comparison of active and passive case detection of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Guatemala.
 To estimate the degree to which passive case detection underestimates the true incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Guatemala, we compared data from the passive surveillance system of the Guatemalan Ministry of Health with a cross-sectional population-based survey of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Guatemala.
 Of the 2,938 persons interviewed, 143 (5%) reported having had cutaneous leishmaniasis at some time in the past, 37 (1.3%) reported the onset of infection in the 12 months before the survey, 31 (1.1%) had active infections, and 16 (0.5%) had parasitologically confirmed infections.
 Calculated on the basis of these reports and the estimated population of the endemic area, the total number of new cases in the leishmaniasis-endemic area in the 12 months before the survey was approximately 2,574; during the same 12 month period, Ministry of Health data based on passive surveillance listed 64 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis.
 In Guatemala, incidence estimates based on passive surveillance may underestimate the occurrence of cutaneous leishmaniasis by as much as a factor of 40.

279,"Endoscopic screening of early esophageal cancer with the Lugol dye method in patients with head and neck cancers.
 The poor prognosis for esophageal cancer could be improved if lesions were detected at an early stage.
 To detect early esophageal cancer, endoscopic screening of the esophagus with the Lugol dye method was performed in patients with head and neck cancers who were asymptomatic but regarded as being at high risk for synchronous or metachronous esophageal cancer.
 Of 178 patients screened, 9 had esophageal cancer (5.1%).
 Eight of these patients (89%) were at early stages with no lymph node metastasis.
 Most of the lesions (9 of 13 lesions) were not detectable by barium studies or ordinary endoscopic study.
 The epidemiologic statistical analysis of the patients confirmed that they had a significantly high observed and expected number (O/E) ratio (39.7; P less than 0.001).
 These results demonstrate the value of endoscopic screening of the esophagus with the Lugol dye method in patients with head and neck cancers and imply that endoscopic screening with the Lugol dye method may be useful for detecting early esophageal cancer in individuals at risk for other causes.

429,"Variations in sensitivity after sectioning the intercostobrachial nerve.
 The authors present a prospective study of the variations in sensitivity that appear in the armpit and arm after the intercostobrachial nerve has been sectioned in a modified radical mastectomy.
 Of a total of 208 patients studied between 1978 and 1987, the intercostobrachial nerve was sectioned in 139 patients, whereas in 30 it remained intact; in 39 patients only peripheral branches of the nerve were sectioned.
 The patients were examined at regular postoperative intervals in order to evaluate their sensitivity both to touch and to pain in the axilla and arm.
 Four hundred thirty-three examinations were carried out and the 3 operative groups were assessed accordingly.
 After the nerve was sectioned, there was increasing anesthesia in the armpit and hypoesthesia on the posterointernal face of the arm, while for the patients in whom the intercostobrachial nerve remained intact, these alterations were less intense and long-lasting.
 Significant statistical differences between the two groups also exist.
 In the absence of axillary lymphatic ganglia infiltrated by the tumor, the conservation of the intercostobrachial nerve is recommended.

209,"Carcinoma of the male breast: a review of 41 cases.
 We reviewed the cases of 41 consecutive men treated for breast carcinoma from 1950 through 1987 at Vanderbilt University Affiliated Hospitals to examine controversies in and methods of therapy for this disease.
 Twenty-two patients (52%) had stage I or II lesions potentially curable by operative therapy.
 The overall 5-year survival rates were 100% for stage I, 65% for stage II, 56% for stage III, and 0% for stage IV.
 Radical mastectomy offered no advantage over modified radical mastectomy in terms of survival or rate of recurrence.
 Diagnosis at an early clinical stage and no finding of disease in axillary lymph nodes were important factors in survival in this series of patients.
 All tumors evaluated for hormone receptors were positive.
 Although experience was limited, encouraging results were obtained with the use of tamoxifen citrate in adjuvant as well as palliative roles.
 With the exception of a predominance of centrally located lesions and a uniquely high frequency of positive hormone receptor status, carcinoma of the male breast appears biologically similar to the disease in women, and treatment should be guided by similar principles.

514,"Synthetic analogues of fumagillin that inhibit angiogenesis and suppress tumour growth.
 Neovascularization is critical for the growth of tumours and is a dominant feature in a variety of angiogenic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, haemangiomas, arthritis and psoriasis.
 Recognition of the potential therapeutic benefit of controlling unabated capillary growth has led to a search for safe and effective angiogenesis inhibitors.
 We report here the synthesis of a family of novel inhibitors that are analogues of fumagillin, a naturally secreted antibiotic of Aspergillus fumigatus fresenius.
 We first isolated this fungus from a contaminated culture of capillary endothelial cells.
 Purified fumagillin inhibited endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and tumour-induced angiogenesis in vivo; it also inhibited tumour growth in mice, but prolonged administration was limited because it caused severe weight loss.
 Synthesis of fumagillin analogues yielded potent angiogenesis inhibitors ('angioinhibins') which suppress the growth of a wide variety of tumours with relatively few side-effects.

284,"Expression of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor gene in human colorectal tumor.
 Expression of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) gene was examined by Northern blotting analyses in 31 human colorectal tumors that included two benign adenomas and 26 adenocarcinomas.
 Among the total of 28 cases which proved to be adequate for mRNA analyses, all but one showed the expression of PSTI at various levels.
 In contrast, PSTI expression was not detected in two malignant lymphomas of the rectum.
 The level of PSTI expression was not correlated with the patient's age, sex, tumor location or size, stage of differentiation, lymph node metastasis, or progression stage.
 Some colorectal adenocarcinomas were also shown to express genes that can hybridize with human trypsinogen cDNA probe.
 It looks as though in these tumors, a protease(s) and its inhibitor are produced simultaneously as part of a cellular self-defense mechanism.

248,"Oral contraceptives and breast cancer.
 Among women in general the risk of breast cancer through 59 years of age does not appear to be affected appreciably by the use of oral contraceptives.
 Nonetheless, concern continues to be expressed about the effects of early age at first use, long-term duration of use, formulation, and a variety of other factors thought to influence breast cancer risk in the presence of oral contraception.
 A number of recent studies restricted to young women suggest that long-term use may increase the risk of disease occurring very early, but the present lack of consistent findings in well-conducted epidemiologic studies prevents any certain conclusion with regard to cause-and-effect.
 However, if an increased risk were indeed present, the most plausible interpretation is that long-term oral contraception promotes earlier clinical manifestation of breast cancer in some women while having no net impact on their lifetime risk of the disease.

233,"Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (TA-4) in penile carcinoma.
 TA-4 antigen, originally isolated from women with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, is elevated in the sera of patients with squamous cell carcinomas of several sites, including esophagus, lungs, and head and neck.
 In this study, we compared the serum levels of TA-4 in normal volunteers, patients with resected penile squamous cell carcinoma, and patients with metastatic penile squamous cell carcinoma.
 TA-4 values were elevated in 5 of 11 patients (45%) who had metastatic disease.
 In 2, TA-4 was normal the first time metastasis was clinically detected but rose as the disease progressed.
 Moreover, in 3 patients in whom serial determinations were made, serum TA-4 values correlated well with disease progression and response to treatment.
 We conclude that TA-4 values are elevated in some patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the penis and may become a useful marker for monitoring response to therapy.

265,"The technicon H6000 analyzer discriminates chronic lymphocytic leukemia from other B-cell leukemias through automatic assessment of large unstained cells.
 The separation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell origin from other chronic B-cell leukemias is subjective, being largely based on the morphologic features of the lymphoid cells in the peripheral blood.
 The percentage of large unstained cells determined with a Technicon H6000 analyzer (an automated blood cell differential analyzer, Technicon Instruments Corp, Tarrytown, NY) was used as a cell volume variable in an investigation of 70 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell origin and of other chronic B-cell leukemias.
 The significant degree of correlation between the percentage of large unstained cells and morphoimmunophenotypic diagnosis, although obtained for a relatively small number of cases, suggests that this method of cell volume analysis can be used to improve diagnostic reproducibility in chronic B-cell leukemia.

 The clinical course of the papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas is contrasted with that of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
 The former occurs predominantly in young women, has a low malignant potential, and is highly curable with surgical treatment.
 Three cases are reported that illustrate the typical clinical features and the indolent nature of the tumor.
 One case was discovered after blunt abdominal trauma resulted in rupture of the tumor and hemoperitoneum.
 All cases were treated by pancreatic resection with preservation of the spleen, an important consideration in younger patients.
 All patients were free of disease at long-term follow-up.
 Increasing awareness of this tumor has resulted in the reclassification of several tumors and should lead to better recognition by surgeons caring for patients with pancreatic diseases.

 High rates of leukaemia in children and young people have been associated with features of community isolation and population growth.
 Incidence data collected by two specialist registries were used to compare incidence rates at ward level with relevant ward characteristics derived from routine census and Ordnance Survey data for England and Wales.
 An excess risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was found for wards which are farthest from large urban centres.
 The excess was greatest for wards of higher socioeconomic status and for children aged 1-7 years (the childhood peak), for which a two-fold excess was seen.
 These findings in general support the hypothesis that childhood leukaemia has an infectious aetiology.

 We have studied eight cases of an acquired lymphatic endothelial lesion for which we propose the name ""benign lymphangioendothelioma."" The lesions developed as solitary, slowly extending, erythematous macules and plaques, usually occurring on the extremities or the shoulders in adolescents or adults.
 The characteristic histopathologic feature is permeation of the dermal collagen by flattened, endothelium-lined channels and spaces.
 Hemorrhage, iron deposition, and inflammation were not part of the lesion.
 Ulex europaeus agglutinin I labeled the lesional endothelial cells consistently, but factor VIII-related antigen labeling was negative.
 This histologic pattern and the special studies suggested a lymphatic lesion.

 As part of a series of investigations into the health of Vietnam veterans, we conducted a population-based, case-control study of soft-tissue and other sarcomas between 1984 and 1988.
 All men born between 1929 and 1953 and diagnosed in an area covered by eight cancer registries were considered eligible.
 Controls were selected by random-digit dialing.
 Analyses of 342 men with pathologically confirmed sarcoma and 1776 controls showed that Vietnam veterans had a relative risk of 1.0 for sarcoma in comparison with men who did not serve in Vietnam (95% confidence interval, 0.6 to 1.6).
 Restriction of the analysis to the 254 men with soft-tissue sarcoma yielded a relative risk of 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.6).
 Several attributes of military service in Vietnam (eg, branch, duration of service, military region, and other characteristics that may have been associated with the use of Agent Orange) were examined, and none was associated with an increased risk for the development of sarcoma.
 Furthermore, no morphologic type of sarcoma was overrepresented among Vietnam veterans.
 Results were unchanged if Vietnam veterans were compared with (1) other veterans or (2) men who never served in the military.
 This study, which had 97% power to detect a relative risk of 2.0 for all sarcomas, provides no evidence that the risk for the development of soft-tissue or other sarcomas is increased among veterans 15 to 25 years following service in Vietnam.

 A review of the English literature yielded 146 instances of this uncommon tumor.
 Eighty-four per cent were papillary adenocarcinoma of thyroid type and 5 per cent were squamous cell carcinoma.
 The patients were from six to 81 years old with a 2:1 female to male ratio.
 Metastatic disease to lymph nodes was noted in 11 per cent and invasion of overlying strap muscles was found in 4 per cent.
 Carcinoma of the thyroid gland occurred in 14 per cent.
 Preoperative diagnosis was rare.
 The Sistrunk procedure is recommended for initial surgical therapy with further surgical or adjuvant therapy dependent on associated clinical findings.

400,"Introduction of nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors into a medulloblastoma cell line results in expression of high- and low-affinity NGF receptors but not NGF-mediated differentiation.
 Expression of the cloned human nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) cDNA in cell lines can generate both high- and low-affinity binding sites.
 Since the inability to respond appropriately to differentiation factors such as NGF may contribute to determining the malignant phenotype of neuroblastomas, we sought to determine whether the same is true of medulloblastomas.
 To generate a human central nervous system neuronal cell line that would respond to NGF, we infected the medulloblastoma cell line D283 MED with a defective retrovirus carrying the cDNA coding for the human NGFR.
 The resultant cells (MED-NGFR) expressed abundant low- and high-affinity NGFRs, and NGF treatment induced a rapid transient increase of c-fos mRNA in the NGFR-expressing cells but not in the parent line or in cells infected with virus lacking the cDNA insert.
 However, the MED-NGFR cells did not internalize the NGFR at high efficiency, nor did they differentiate in response to NGF.
 Three important conclusions emerge from this study: (i) internalization of NGFRs is not necessary for some early rapid transcriptional effects of NGF; (ii) an unknown factor(s) that cooperates with the cloned NGFR in allowing high-affinity NGF binding is found in a primitive central nervous system cell line; and (iii) NGFRs introduced into and expressed by D283 MED (i.e., MED-NGFR) cells are partially functional but are unable to induce differentiation in these primitive neuron-like tumor cells, implying that high-efficiency receptor-mediated endocytosis of NGF and its receptor may be a necessary step in the cascade of events leading to NGF-mediated differentiation.

488,"Can internal mammary chain treatment decrease the risk of death for patients with medial breast cancers and positive axillary lymph nodes?
 The effect of internal mammary chain treatment on each type of malignant death-related event was analyzed in 1195 patients with operable breast cancer and histologically involved axillary lymph nodes.
 A group of 135 patients who had no internal mammary chain treatment was compared with a control group of 1060 patients who were treated by surgery and/or postoperative radiation therapy.
 In a multivariate analysis taking into account age, clinical size of the tumor, histoprognostic grading, and the number of positive axillary lymph nodes, quantitative interaction tests were used to determine whether the effects of internal mammary chain treatment on each type of malignant event were significantly different for patients with a lateral tumor compared with those with a medial tumor.
 The authors found that the effects of this treatment on the risks of distant metastases and of secondary breast cancer were not the same for the patients with a medial tumor as for those with a lateral tumor.
 For the untreated patients with a medial tumor, the risks of distant metastases and second breast cancer were, respectively, 1.6 (P = 0.02) and 2.9 (P = 0.02), compared with the treated patients.
 Conversely, for women with lateral tumor, no difference between the two treatment groups was observed.
 Thus, internal mammary chain treatment may improve long-term survival rate in patients with a medial tumor and positive axillary lymph nodes essentially by decreasing the risk of development of distant metastases (mainly brain, distant lymph nodes, multiple simultaneous metastases) and/or a secondary breast cancer.

491,"The effect of dietary omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil) on azoxymethanol-induced focal areas of dysplasia and colon tumor incidence.
 MaxEPA (MA), a fish oil high in omega-3 fatty acids, was combined with various levels of corn oil (CO), rich in omega-6 fatty acids, and fed to female CF1 mice.
 The three fish oil blends with CO and the two CO levels of the diets studied were as follows: 16.0% CO + 4.4% MA (Diet 1); 10.2% CO + 10.2% MA (Diet 2); 4.4% CO + 16.0% MA (Diet 3); 20.4% CO (Diet 4); and 4.4% CO (Diet 5).
 The diets were provided 2 weeks before weekly subcutaneous injection of saline or azoxymethanol (AOM).
 Studies of epithelial cell proliferation and the incidence of focal areas of dysplasia (FAD) involved six weekly AOM injections.
 One week after the last AOM injection and 1 hour before killing, mice were injected with tritiated thymidine (3HTdR).
 No differences in any proliferative parameters were found among the five groups of saline-treated mice.
 Among the AOM-treated animals, those fed Diet 3 showed significantly fewer cells per crypt and significantly fewer labeled cells/gland than CO Diets 4 and 5.
 Additionally, the distribution of S-phase cells in crypts of AOM-treated mice fed Diet 3 most closely resembled that of the saline controls.
 The greatest alteration in the distribution of proliferative cells was observed in the high-CO diet (Diet 4) and the lowest MA level (Diet 1).
 Mice fed Diets 2 and 3 had significantly fewer FAD/500 microns of distal colonic serial sections than those fed the high CO diet (Diet 4).
 Mice involved in chronic tumor incidence studies received only three weekly injections of the same dose of AOM.
 Regardless of diet, approximately 88% of all tumors arose in the distal colon.
 A significantly larger tumor-bearing population was observed in both the high-CO Diet 4 and the lowest MaxEPA (MA) diet (Diet 1) compared with the incidence in MA Diets 2 and 3 and the low-CO Diet 5.
 A diet with a ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids of approximately 1.0 apparently prevented the development of an adenoma-type proliferative pattern thereby reducing FAD numbers and subsequent tumor incidence.

448,"Erythrocyte stearic acid desaturation in patients with colorectal carcinoma.
 The erythrocyte stearic:oleic acid ratio (saturation index) was investigated as a means of differentiating between control subjects (n = 146) and patients with benign (n = 48) and malignant (n = 117) colorectal disease and patients undergoing postoperative follow-up after curative resection (n = 49).
 Erythrocyte fatty acid profiles were determined by gas liquid chromatography.
 Neither age, sex, Dukes' stage, nor degree of differentiation of the tumors had a significant effect on the erythrocyte saturation index.
 The erythrocyte saturation index was lower in patients with primary and recurrent colorectal cancer compared with control subjects and patients with inflammatory bowel disease or benign colonic polyps (P less than 0.0001).
 The erythrocyte saturation index was not found to be useful in the postoperative follow-up of these patients.
 Using both saturation index and age as a means of differentiating between patients with primary colorectal cancer and control subjects gave a sensitivity of 67 percent and a specificity of 81 percent.

168,"Immunocytochemical estrogen and progestin receptor assays in breast cancer with monoclonal antibodies. Histopathologic, demographic, and biochemical correlations and relationship to endocrine response and survival.
 Breast cancer specimens from 600 women were assayed for estrogen receptors (ER) using an immunocytochemical assay (ICA) employing the monoclonal antiestrophilin antibody H222 Sp gamma.
 Results showed significant correlation with biochemical ER determinations as well as with tumor grade and menopausal status.
 In 449 cases, results of progesterone receptor assay by ICA using the monoclonal anti-PgR antibody KD 68, also correlated significantly with biochemical PgR measurements.
 The ERICA/PgRICA positivity was significantly more frequent in postmenopausal white women.
 Colloid carcinomas were most likely to be ERICA positive and PgRICA positive whereas medullary carcinomas were most often negative.
 In 47 patients with advanced mammary carcinoma, results of ERICA and PgRICA were more closely related to endocrine response than those of ER and PgR by dextran-coated charcoal assay (DCC).
 In 339 women with Stage I or Stage II breast cancer, ERICA was significantly associated with disease-free survival.
 Analysis by Cox's proportional hazard model, however, showed PgRICA to be the best predictor of survival and disease-free survival in 197 women at the same stages of disease.
 These data indicate that ICA is more predictive of prognosis than biochemical ER and PgR.
 The ease of ICA performance coupled with these results indicate that the method is an acceptable substitute for DCC in analyzing breast cancers for ER/PgR.

221,"Male breast cancer.
 Male breast cancer is uncommon but important.
 The diagnosis is easily made by breast biopsy, and patients are presenting earlier in the course of the disease than in the past.
 Despite this, patients are often first seen with tumors that have metastasized to the axillary nodes, which markedly decreases the survival rate.
 Therapy of localized disease includes simple excision, modified radical mastectomy, and radical mastectomy, but there is no consensus for which operation is appropriate.
 Radiation therapy should be strongly considered in patients with metastases to the axillary nodes, but the role of adjuvant hormonal therapy or chemotherapy is unclear.
 For treatment of disseminated disease, tamoxifen seems to be replacing orchiectomy.
 The favorable response rate, especially in patients with estrogen-receptor-positive tumors, the lack of side effects, and the high level of patient acceptability make it an attractive therapeutic choice.

364,"Reduction of the membrane fluidity of human breast cancer cells by tamoxifen and 17 beta-estradiol.
 The intracellular steady-state levels of methotrexate were previously shown to be reduced in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative human breast cancer MDA-MB-436 cells and ER-positive human breast cancer MCF7 cells following treatment with pharmacologically relevant concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol (E2).
 We now report that both E2 and tamoxifen (TMX) significantly decreased the fluidity of MCF7 and MDA-MB-436 cellular membranes.
 With E2 or TMX at concentrations greater than 1 microM, perturbations in membrane fluidity were accompanied by apparently non-ER-mediated cytotoxicity.
 Alterations in membrane structure may have contributed to the cytotoxicity of high-dose endocrine therapy and to the ability of E2 to inhibit methotrexate transport and cytotoxicity in some human breast cancer cells.

358,"Squamous cell carcinoma-antigen for detection of squamous cell and mucoepidermoid carcinoma after primary treatment: a preliminary report.
 This study evaluated the efficacy of using the periodic measurement of the serum level of squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-antigen) for determining the local recurrence and/or metastasis of squamous cell and mucoepidermoid carcinomas after primary treatment.
 It was found that at the time of clinical recognition of recurrence, the SCC-antigen level was normal, but metastasis to regional lymph nodes or to remote organs generally was accompanied by an increase of SCC-antigen.
 Changes in the SCC-antigen level with mucoepidermoid carcinoma seemed to be less sensitive than with squamous cell carcinoma.

307,"Early gastric cancer. Endoscopic diagnosis of depth of invasion.
 In order to decide on a treatment strategy against gastric cancers, an accurate preoperative evaluation of the depth of cancer invasion is essential.
 Preoperative endoscopic diagnosis of the depth of invasion was compared with pathological results of the resected specimen in 206 early gastric cancers and 32 early-like advanced gastric cancers.
 The endoscopic distinction between early and early-like advanced cancers was correctly made in 83.6% of the cases.
 Among the early gastric cancers, mucosal and submucosal invasion was correctly presumed in 71.9% of the cases.
 When the tumor was an elevated type, or located in the antrum, the endoscopic diagnosis tended to be deeper than the true depth.
 The size of tumor contributed little to the depth diagnosis.
 Pathomorphological changes on the tips of converging folds were the important clue for diagnosing depth.

579,"Fine needle aspiration biopsy in the diagnosis and management of fibroadenoma of the breast.
 Cytological and histological biopsies were obtained on 75 breast lumps clinically diagnosed as fibroadenomas.
 Of these, 95 per cent of lesions were benign.
 In 51 (68 per cent) confirmed as fibroadenomas histologically, cytology was benign in 78 per cent, but inadequate for diagnosis in 16 per cent.
 The remaining 24 lesions included three breast cancers and one lymph node with Hodgkin's disease.
 In this group cytology was inadequate for diagnosis in 54 per cent, including one breast cancer.
 No lesion with benign cytology was subsequently shown to be malignant.
 The study supports the view that clinical diagnosis and cytology are accurate in the diagnosis of benign breast disease of this type.
 Breast cancer may rarely present with the clinical features of a fibroadenoma and too few lesions have been studied to assess fully the performance of cytological biopsy in detecting these small mobile lesions.
 A non-excisional policy should therefore include prolonged follow-up and repeat biopsy.

213,"Selection of breast-preservation therapy for primary invasive breast carcinoma.
 Breast-preservation treatment for primary breast cancer should not be used for all women.
 Women frequently excluded from consideration for such treatment or who choose not to have it may be elderly and not concerned about cosmetic appearance or live at a distance so that 6 weeks of daily trips to radiotherapy would be inconvenient or even impossible.
 Also, if radiotherapeutic expertise or facilities are not available, a breast-preservation program is difficult.
 In Massachusetts, a full course of just over 6000 cGy (4500 cGy to the whole breast and a 1600-cGy local boost) costs roughly $6000.
 Thus, breast preservation is more expensive than mastectomy even with reconstruction, as patients still frequently require a hospital admission with general anesthesia for an axillary dissection.
 Although insurance policies cover such expenses, patients who do not have insurance or have inadequate coverage may find the extra expense of the breast-preservation technique burdensome or impossible.
 Women with a small breast and a proportionately large cancer may have an unsatisfactory cosmetic outcome after appropriate lumpectomy.
 The cosmetic result in such patients frequently cannot be predicted beforehand; this fact adds emphasis to the need for a two-step process of lumpectomy and then re-evaluation of the cosmetic outcome as well as pathologic features for decisions regarding breast preservation.
 Finally, women may have strikingly different attitudes toward breast preservation than expected by the surgeon.
 For some women, the urge to preserve the breast is so strong that they will accept virtually any risk to achieve this option, whereas for other women, the constant anxiety about a recurrence or undergoing radiation therapy is traumatic enough that they readily accept mastectomy.
 In our referral surgical oncology practice, roughly 60% of patients are currently treated with breast-preservation techniques; the remainder undergo mastectomy, with immediate reconstruction in approximately three fourths of the cases.
 The proportion of patients who elect to have breast preservation depends greatly on local medical customs and attitudes; the radiotherapeutic skills available; women's attitudes, which frequently are dependent on the local press and publicity; and the surgeon's interest and enthusiasm for such a program.
 There is no appropriate proportion of patients who should be treated by breast-preservation techniques, but clearly, the proportion of patients so treated increases with experience, acceptability, publicity, and availability.
 Thus, the selection of breast-preserving therapy for individual patients is a result of an extraordinary array of factors that need to be considered in each patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

416,"Dietary fat and risk of breast cancer.
 The relationship between dietary fat and subsequent risk of breast cancer was studied in 3988 initially cancer-free Finnish women aged 20-69 y.
 During a follow-up period of 20 y, 54 breast-cancer cases were diagnosed.
 Risk of breast cancer was significantly inversely related to energy intake and nonsignificantly inversely related to absolute fat intake.
 A positive association between energy-adjusted total fat intake and occurrence of breast cancer was also observed.
 The relative risk in the highest tertile as compared with the lowest tertile was 1.7 (95% confidence limits 0.6-4.8).
 The corresponding relative risks were 1.4 (0.5-3.7) for saturated fatty acids, 2.7 (1.0-7.4) for monounsaturated fatty acids, 1.2 (0.6-2.8) for polyunsaturated fatty acids, and 2.2 (1.0-5.0) for cholesterol intake.
 Adjustment for different potential confounding factors did not alter the results.
 The present data suggest that breast cancer is associated inversely with energy intake and weakly positively with energy-adjusted fat intake.

237,"Bcr/abl recombinant DNA analysis versus karyotype in the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of chronic myeloid leukemia.
 Karyotype and bcr/abl recombinant DNA analyses are two means of detecting the chromosomal aberration in chronic myeloid leukemia.
 The authors compared these two methods in a retrospective study of 36 patients with CML in which they found the bcr/abl DNA recombinant event in 100% (29 of 29) of those patients who had the Philadelphia chromosome.
 To achieve this sensitivity, a battery of two bcr probes and three restriction enzymes is necessary.
 The authors propose a sequential algorithm for efficient use of these probes and enzymes.
 In 76% of the patients, bcr/abl rearrangement can be detected with a Bgl II digest and a 3' commercial probe.
 An additional 21% of patients can be detected by a second assay in which the same membrane is rehybridized to a 3' and 5' combination bcr probe.
 One patient (3%) required an additional restriction enzyme digest with BamH I to detect the recombinant event by the same 3' probe.
 Karyotype analysis is used to determine cytogenetic remission in patients with CML under therapy.
 The authors studied the use of DNA analysis by the Southern blot technique to detect a decrease in the relative number of leukemic cells.
 By dilution studies and densitometric scanning of autoradiographs, the authors were able to detect a 15% decrease in the relative number of cells having the bcr/abl recombinant event.
 The authors report the preliminary results of three patients in whom they compared the karyotype and recombinant DNA analysis at multiple time points in their clinical course.
 In conclusion, the bcr/abl recombinant DNA analysis is superior to karyotype for the diagnosis of CML and can be used for monitoring treated patients.

549,"Rapid inactivation and phosphorylation of pyroglutamyl peptidase II in Y-79 human retinoblastoma cells after exposure to phorbol ester.
 Pyroglutamyl peptidase II (EC 3.4.19.-), a membrane-bound metalloproteinase, is a highly specific TRH-degrading enzyme.
 Exposure of Y-79 human retinoblastoma cells to 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) decreased the activity of this enzyme in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (IC50 5 x 10(-9) M).
 After 15 min of TPA treatment, only 10% of pyroglutamyl peptidase II activity remained.
 TPA treatment did not affect the activity of the cytosolic enzyme pyroglutamyl peptidase I (EC 3.4.19.3) or the membrane-bound enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (EC 3.4.19.3).
 Pretreatment of the cells with the protein kinase C inhibitors H-7 or sphingosine prevented the inactivation of pyroglutamyl peptidase II by TPA.
 The time course of the TPA-mediated effect paralleled the time course of translocation and activation of protein kinase C in this cell line.
 Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that inactivation of pyroglutamyl peptidase II was not due to dissociation or internalization of this enzyme molecule.
 Incubation of TPA-activated Y-79 cell membranes with gamma-[32P]-ATP followed by immunoprecipitation revealed a time-dependent phosphorylation of a 48 kilodalton subunit of pyroglutamyl peptidase II.
 These studies indicate that the phorbol ester effect is mediated by protein kinase C, and reveal a mechanism of potentiation of the action of TRH at its target sites.

356,"Colorectal cancer: have we identified an effective screening strategy?
 Three currently used screening methods are aimed at detecting colorectal cancer when it is asymptomatic and curable, and at detecting polyps so that they can be removed before they can progress to cancer.
 Digital rectal examinations are relatively cheap and easy but can detect only a small fraction of large-bowel cancers.
 Sigmoidoscopy is more sensitive, but its low acceptability to patients has been only partially mitigated by the introduction of the 35-cm flexible instrument.
 Fecal occult blood testing has limited sensitivity because blood from cancers and polyps is neither continuously shed nor uniformly distributed in feces; specificity and positive predictive value are also low because of other sources of blood in the stool.
 Prudent judgment suggests that all of these screening tests may prevent death from colorectal cancer in some patients.
 However, none has been proven effective in general use by well-controlled studies.
 Case-control studies can provide timely and valuable new evidence in this regard; the authors' investigations in progress are described.
 The current lack of strong evidence in support of these screening tests should not be interpreted as evidence against their use.

397,"Adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor/thioredoxin, produced by both human T-lymphotropic virus type I- and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes, acts as an autocrine growth factor and synergizes with interleukin 1 and interleukin 2.
 Interleukin 1 (IL-1) has been obtained from the Epstein-Barr virus-infected B-lymphoblastoid cell line 3B6 and shown to be involved in autocrine growth of 3B6 B cells.
 Independently, adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor (ADF) was purified from human T-lymphotropic virus I-infected leukemic T-cell line (ATL-2) and reported as an interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor-inducing factor.
 We have previously reported the same molecular mass, pI, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence for both 3B6-derived IL-1 and ADF.
 cDNA cloning of ADF demonstrated high homology with the prokaryotic disulfide reducing enzyme thioredoxin.
 We show here that ADF and 3B6-derived IL-1 are identical.
 By RNA blot, 3B6 and ATL-2 cells were shown to contain high levels of 0.6-kilobase mRNA corresponding to ADF.
 Such message was not detected in resting peripheral blood lymphocytes but could be weakly induced by lymphocyte activation.
 Antibodies have been raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the NH2 terminus and the COOH terminus of ADF.
 Immunoblotting and sequential immunoprecipitation with these antibodies revealed the same 13-kDa protein in 3B6 and ATL-2 cells.
 Recombinant ADF could sustain growth of 3B6 and ATL-2 cells at low cellular concentration without fetal calf serum; ADF, thus, appears involved in their autocrine growth.
 Similarly, recombinant ADF could enhance growth of other B-cell lines, including the Epstein-Barr virus-negative Burkitt lymphoma line BL41 and the lymphoblastoid cell lines CRAG8, CRB95, and 1G8.
 Finally, recombinant ADF exhibits marked synergism with other cytokines, such as IL-1 and IL-2, allowing virally infected lymphocytes to respond to suboptimal amounts of a variety of growth factors.

278,"Premorphological metabolic changes in human breast carcinogenesis.
 Malignant breast tissue is characterized by morphological and metabolic changes when compared with normal breast tissue.
 In this study, the cytochemical measurement of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity was used to detect abnormal metabolism in breast tissue and to determine whether abnormal metabolic activity precedes morphological change during human breast carcinogenesis.
 Normal and benign breast tissue, morphologically normal tissue from cancer-containing breasts, and malignant breast tissue were studied.
 In malignant tissue, mean(s.e.m.) G6PD activity was significantly increased when compared with normal and benign tissue (9.69(2.3) versus 27.02(1.7) mean integrated extinction (MIE) x 100, P less than 0.01).
 G6PD activity was increased in morphologically normal tissue from cancer-containing breasts when compared with normal and benign breast tissue from breasts with no known cancer (27.02(1.7) versus 18.42(2.6) MIE x 100, P less than 0.05).
 These findings suggest that metabolic abnormalities precede morphological changes in breast carcinogenesis.
 Abnormal metabolism can be detected widely within a cancer-containing breast.
 The detection of such abnormality may prove helpful in identifying patients at high risk of developing breast cancer.

 Discrepant results in long-term survival between United States and Japanese patients with resectable gastric adenocarcinoma may result from more accurate staging in the Japanese series.
 The authors compared a comprehensive fat-clearing method with the conventional pathology method of lymph node sampling in 11 patients undergoing curative gastrectomy and extended lymphadenectomy at their institution.
 Comprehensive fat-clearing doubled total lymph node counts (P less than 0.01), identified smaller lymph nodes (P less than 0.001), and identified more histologically involved nodes of significantly smaller size (P less than 0.001).
 Comprehensive fat-clearing pathologically upstaged 29% of the authors' eligible specimens.

267,"Tumor of the atrioventricular nodal region. A clinical and immunohistochemical study.
 Autopsy specimens of 17 tumors of the atrioventricular nodal region were studied.
 Sudden death occurred in 14 children and adults; seven of these patients had a history of atrioventricular block or syncope.
 Three tumors were incidental findings in infants with other congenital anomalies; diaphragmatic agenesis, pulmonary hypoplasia, and Meckel's diverticulum in one patient; mitral atresia in one; and congenital hydrocephalus, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of the aorta, and patent omphalovitelline duct in the third.
 Immunohistochemical stains demonstrated strong positivity for carcinoembryonic antigen in 13 of 13 cases, B72.3 antigen in 5 of 7 cases, and cytokeratin in 11 of 11 cases.
 Twenty control cases of mesothelioma and mesothelial hyperplasia were all negative for B72.3; one showed focal carcinoembryonic antigen staining.
 Ultrastructural analysis of one case demonstrated short rudimentary microvilli not characteristic of mesothelial cells.
 We conclude that so-called mesotheliomas of the atrioventricular nodal region are not of mesothelial origin, because of strong carcinoembryonic antigen positivity and occasional positivity with B72.3, as these antibodies react with glycoproteins found in endodermally derived tissue and generally not with mesothelial tissue.
 Conduction system tumors are most likely congenital rests of endodermal origin, can be associated with other congenital anomalies, and often cause symptoms of heart block and sudden death.

 A rare tumor not easily classifiable among published histologic categories for salivary gland tumors is reported.
 The neoplasm developed within the submandibular gland of a 78-year-old woman with invasion of the mandible and metastasis to regional lymph nodes.
 Histopathologically, cuboidal cells possessing clear cytoplasm and displaced round nuclei proliferated and exhibited an adenomatous pattern.
 Many cystic spaces surrounded by tumor cell strands were seen, mucus substance filled in the cystic spaces, and the tumor cells seemed mucus-secreting, but neither epidermoid cells nor papillary appearance could be observed.
 Electromicroscopically, numerous mucous droplets of low electron density were prominent in the cytoplasm, and the tumor cells had sparse irregular microvilli on the luminal surface.
 Mucin histochemistry, including paradoxical concanavalin A staining, revealed that the tumor cells contained neutral and acid mucins, and these were identified as class II and III mucosubstances.
 No other neoplastic lesion, except recurrent metastatic neck nodes, has been detected 6 years after the first examination, and it seems that the tumor is a rare primary mucinous adenocarcinoma of the submandibular gland.

 The stability of an arthrodesis with two cancellous-bone screws across the ankle joint was evaluated in eighteen ankles from fresh-frozen cadavera.
 Tibiotalar motion was recorded in response to the following loading modes: medial-lateral moment, plantar flexion-dorsiflexion moment, and internal-external tibial torque.
 The series of loading tests was performed with two cancellous-bone screws through the tibia into the talus and a lateral fibular strut graft fixed with a proximal and a distal screw.
 The tests were repeated after the strut graft was removed, and again after it had been reapplied.
 The amount of motion at the site of the arthrodesis was greatest with tibial torque and was least with medial-lateral bending; this was true for specimens with or without a fibular strut graft.
 Removal of the strut graft allowed increased tibiotalar motion for all modes of loading; increases in motion were far greater for specimens of poor bone quality.

 Clinical criteria for the classification of symptomatic idiopathic (primary) osteoarthritis (OA) of the hands were developed from data collected in a multicenter study.
 Patients with OA were compared with a group of patients who had hand symptoms from other causes, such as rheumatoid arthritis and the spondylarthropathies.
 Variables from the medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and radiographs were analyzed.
 All patients had pain, aching, or stiffness in the hands.
 Patients were classified as having clinical OA if on examination there was hard tissue enlargement involving at least 2 of 10 selected joints, swelling of fewer than 3 metacarpophalangeal joints, and hard tissue enlargement of at least 2 distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints.
 If the patient had fewer than 2 enlarged DIP joints, then deformity of at least 1 of the 10 selected joints was necessary in order to classify the symptoms as being due to OA.
 The 10 selected joints were the second and third DIP, the second and third proximal interphalangeal, and the trapeziometacarpal (base of the thumb) joints of both hands.
 Criteria derived using the ""classification tree"" method were 92% sensitive and 98% specific.
 The ""traditional format"" classification method required that at least 3 of these 4 criteria be present to classify a patient as having OA of the hand.
 The latter sensitivity was 94% and the specificity was 87%.

 Manual analysis of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) was performed in 33 patients with polymyositis of whom 16 were studied in the acute stage and 17 in the chronic stage.
 Contrary to common description of ""myopathic potentials"" as being of low amplitude, short duration, and polyphasic shape, the quantitated study revealed no difference as to amplitude of short duration MUAPs in patients and normal subjects though short-duration MUAP and short duration polyphasic potentials were 4 and 3 times, respectively, more common in patients than in controls.
 Although the mean duration of MUAPs usually was significantly shorter in polymyositis than in controls, the average scatter of MUAPs duration was the same in the 2 groups.
 The average incidence of polyphasic MUAPs was 4 times higher in patients than in controls, as was the incidence of those of long duration.
 To avoid misinterpretation of EMG findings due to an excess of polyphasic MUAPs, a greater number of individual potentials than usually recommended should be collected allowing a valid estimate of the mean duration of MUAPs of simple configuration.

 This report describes three patients with spinal epidural abscess diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging and treated nonoperatively.
 Prior to treatment, one patient was neurologically intact, one patient demonstrated a moderate neurological deficit, and one patient was severely paraparetic with loss of bladder and bowel control.
 Following identification of the pathogenic organism, antibiotic therapy was continued until the patients demonstrated clinical improvement and radiological resolution of the abscess.
 All patients remained stable or improved neurologically.
 Analysis of 33 previously reported patients treated with antibiotics suggests that nonoperative treatment may be a reasonable alternative therapy under certain clinical conditions.
 These include (1) identification of the pathogenic organism, (2) a stable neurological condition, (3) access to magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography for potentially rapid reevaluation, and (4) appropriate neurosurgical consultation and nursing care.
 Nonoperative treatment may also be considered as a reasonable alternative for patients who have severe concurrent medical illness.

686,"The effects of synthetic human secretin on calcium carbonate solubility in human bile 
 This study sought to determine the effects of synthetic human secretin on ionized calcium and carbonate concentrations in human hepatic bile.
 Five patients with a nasobiliary drain in the right hepatic duct were studied.
 Three basal samples of bile were collected, each over a 15-minute period.
 Synthetic human secretin was then infused IV at 0.05 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 for 45 minutes followed by 0.5 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 for 45 minutes.
 Bile was sampled over 15-minute periods.
 To document return to baseline conditions, two further samples of bile were obtained over 15-minute periods 2 hours after the infusion was terminated.
 Bile acid concentration was determined by an enzymatic method; pH and PCO2 were measured with an automated analyzer.
 Total calcium was determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry and ionized calcium by an ion-specific electrode.
 Bicarbonate and carbonate concentrations were calculated using Henry's law and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.
 The fraction of bile sampled by the catheter was determined by Indocyanin Green recovery at the end of the experiment.
 Secretin caused an increase in bile flow and bicarbonate output.
 Bicarbonate concentrations increased from 26 +/- 3 mmol/L to 41 +/- 3 mmol/L (P less than 0.05), and chloride concentrations decreased.
 Mean bile acid concentrations declined significantly from 14.6 +/- 2 mmol/L to 4.7 +/- 1 mmol/L (P less than 0.05).
 Ionized calcium concentrations decreased from 0.7 +/- 0.005 mmol/L to 0.5 +/- 0.02 mmol/L (P less than 0.05) while pH increased significantly from 7.44 +/- 0.06 to 7.6 +/- 0.04 (P less than 0.05).
 Carbonate concentrations increased significantly from 0.15 +/- 0.02 mmol/L to 0.26 +/- 0.03 mmol/L, and the ion product for calcium carbonate increased significantly from 0.099 +/- 0.002 (mmol/L)2 to 0.135 +/- 0.015 (mmol/L)2 (P less than 0.05).

 The study took place in a 12-bed medical respiratory intensive care unit in a large teaching hospital.
 Twenty-one patients had OLT performed over a 21.5-month period (January 1988 to October 15, 1989) for end stage liver disease (ESLD) from a variety of causes.
 A flow-directed right heart catheter and an indwelling arterial cannula were inserted for hemodynamic monitoring over a 96-hour postoperative period.
 Liver and renal function studies, total serum calcium, serum albumin, and fluid balance were determined daily.
 The SVR increased significantly to 12.8 +/- 0.6 U at 48 hours compared with immediate (less than 8 hours) postoperative levels (p less than 0.05) and remained elevated for 96 hours.
 The CO fell progressively and was significantly lower than baseline values from 64 to 96 hours.
 There was significant inverse correlation between the increase in SVR and the fall in CO (r = .85, p less than 0.01).
 The SBP was stable except for a small, but significant fall at 16 and 24 hours postoperatively.
 The PWP increased significantly from a baseline value of 12.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg to 15 +/- 0.9 mm Hg at 32 hours and remained elevated through 96 hours (p less than 0.05).
 The serum bilirubin level fell progressively postoperatively and the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) shortened significantly.
 Bile flow increased progressively from 107 +/- 120 ml/24 hours at the end of the first 24 hours to 188 +/- 125 ml/24 hours by 96 hours postoperatively.
 Five patients died from nine to 43 days postoperatively.
 These patients' hemodynamic parameters were not significantly different from the patients who survived.
 Successful OLT is associated with a rapid increase in SVR and a fall in CO without changes in SBP.
 These findings tend to parallel the improvement found in results of liver function tests.
 However, there is no correlation between the improvement in the hemodynamic state and long-term survival.

830,"Motility changes in primary achalasia following pneumatic dilatation.
 The changes in esophageal motility after pneumatic dilatation were evaluated prospectively in 51 patients with achalasia.
 The patients were evaluated for a median of 14 months.
 Pneumatic dilatation led to a clinical improvement in 41 patients.
 On manometric evaluation, a significant decrease in lower esophageal sphincter pressure was observed (28.4 +/- 14.9 mmHg vs.
 13.5 +/- 7.2 mmHg; p = 0.001); the resting pressure of the esophageal body dropped from 4.8 +/- 4.2 mmHg above gastric baseline to 0.1 +/- 3.9 mmHg below gastric baseline.
 After therapy, peristaltic activity was present in 10/51 (20%) patients; in 1 case, complete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter was recorded.
 Treatment-induced motility changes could not be predicted by clinical history or the lower esophageal sphincter pressure before or after therapy.
 However, the resting pressure of the esophageal body before and after therapy was significantly lower in these patients in whom peristalsis recurred after therapy than in patients with an unchanged motility pattern.
 The reappearance of peristaltic activity after pneumatic dilatation was unrelated to lower esophageal sphincter pressure.
 In conclusion, motility disturbances of the esophageal body in patients with achalasia do not simply reflect the functional obstruction of the lower esophageal sphincter.
 These findings support the hypothesis that achalasia is not a distinct motility disturbance but should be regarded as part of a broad spectrum of different interrelated esophageal motility disorders.

802,"Extracorporeal cholecystolithotripsy without oral chemolitholysis.
 One hundred thirty-six patients completed extracorporeal biliary lithotripsy (EBL) for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.
 Sonographic evidence of complete clearance of all stone fragments was the only criterion for treatment success, which occurred in 32 of the 71 patients (45%) followed up for 24 weeks and in 36 of the 59 patients (61%) followed up for 52 weeks.
 The authors' protocol varied from protocols of other researchers primarily in that no adjuvant chemolitholysis was used.
 However, the number of treatment sessions and total number of shock waves (a maximum of 4,000 shock waves per treatment session, 12,000 shock waves in a patient demonstrating no significant fragmentation, and 20,000 shock waves in a patient whose stones responded well to fragmentation) was higher than those in other reports.
 The results of treatment and complication rates in this study are comparable with those at centers using both shock-wave lithotripsy and chemotherapy.
 The authors conclude that EBL is developing into an important alternative to surgery, which was obviated in all patients with complete clearance of fragments from the gallbladder.

735,"CT diagnosis of acquired small bowel volvulus.
 Small-bowel volvulus is an uncommon but important cause of small-bowel obstruction and often results in ischemia or infarction.
 Clinical examination and plain film radiography may be nondiagnostic, leading to delay in surgical intervention with subsequent increase in morbidity and mortality.
 We present two patients in whom the diagnosis of strangulating small-bowel volvulus was made by computed tomography (CT), allowing rapid surgical correction of this potentially life-threatening condition.

806,"Expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules by mucosal mononuclear phagocytes in inflammatory bowel disease.
 Leukocyte adhesion molecules are important in cell-cell interactions of the immune system.
 Lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (cluster designation 11a) mediates interactions between T cells and mononuclear phagocytes through its ligand, the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (CD54), whereas complement receptors 3 (CD 11b) and 4 (CD11c) are involved in complement-mediated phagocytosis.
 Expression of CD11 molecules and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was studied in colonic biopsy specimens from 20 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and 10 normal controls.
 In normal colon, few mononuclear phagocytes expressed lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 at high densities.
 The major adhesion molecule was CD11c.
 Thus, the largest population of normal colonic mononuclear phagocytes was represented by quiescent, resident macrophages with likely phagocytic function.
 In inflammatory bowel disease, mononuclear phagocytes showed only a slight increase in CD11a expression and no significant change in expression of CD11b and CD11c.
 By contrast, the percentage of mononuclear phagocytes expressing intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was increased from 6.9% +/- 3.9% in controls to 69.2% +/- 12.8% in ulcerative colitis (P less than 0.001) and to 45.7% +/- 22.8% in Crohn's disease (P less than 0.01), showing a close relationship with histological activity.
 The increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 in inflammatory bowel disease indicates a state of immunological activation induced by local release of inflammatory cytokines.
 Such induction of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on mononuclear phagocytes may be important in the maintenance of chronic inflammation by facilitating interactions with T cells and T-cell antigen recognition.

722,"Fibronectin-related substance located in the chief cells of human and rat gastric mucosa.
 A novel substance located in the chief cells of human and rat gastric mucosa, which was detected immunologically by either polyclonal or monoclonal antihuman fibronectin (FN) antibodies, is reported.
 All three polyclonal antihuman FN antibodies used in this study reacted immunohistologically exclusively with the chief cells.
 Monoclonal antibody against C-terminal peptide or cell binding peptide reacted clearly with the human chief cells, but monoclonal antibodies against FN N-terminal and midmolecule failed to react with the cells.
 Western blot analysis of the rat gastric mucosal extract with polyclonal antihuman FN antibody showed that this substance has a molecular weight of about 70,000 Da.
 Therefore, this substance appears to be a fragment containing the C-terminal peptide of whole molecule FN and thus in the present study is named FN-related substance (FNRS).
 In a further study with ethanol-induced ulcer model of the rat, the physiological significance of FNRS was examined.
 The FNRS decreased remarkably, in a dose-dependent manner, in the fundic mucosa of the rats that ingested ethanol.
 The FNRS appeared to be associated with development of mucosal damage and repair, subsequently playing, in part, an important role in the gastric mucosal protection mechanism.

721,"Effect of epidermal growth factor in combination with sucralfate or omeprazole on the healing of chronic gastric ulcers in the rat.
 Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to enhance healing of experimental gastric ulcers when given subcutaneously or orally in the drinking water.
 This effect of EGF occurs without reducing gastric acid secretion.
 On the other hand, EGF reportedly is excreted rapidly from gastric lumen when administered by intragastric bolus.
 This suggests that further stimulation of ulcer healing may be expected if EGF is given with an acid-suppressive agent or with an agent allowing EGF to remain in rat gastric lumen at high concentrations.
 In the present study, EGF administered by gastric intubation at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg, which is three times smaller than reported in previous studies, was evaluated for its effect on acetic acid-induced rat gastric ulcers in combination with sucralfate or omeprazole.
 Sucralfate is well known selectively to bind proteins covering the ulcer base, and omeprazole is a potent acid-suppressive agent.
 Prior to the study of combined EGF and sucralfate, oral sucralfate was confirmed to allow endogenous gastric EGF and mouse EGF given exogenously to remain at high concentrations in gastric contents and tissues.
 EGF and sucralfate (2 g/kg/day) given alone failed to stimulate ulcer healing in submandibularectomized rats (SMR rat) whose endogenous gastric EGF was depleted.
 However, the combination of both drugs administered at the same doses significantly accelerated ulcer healing in the SMR rat.
 Omeprazole (200 mg/kg/day) significantly enhanced ulcer healing regardless of removal of the submandibular glands.
 The combination of EGF and omeprazole further stimulated ulcer healing in the SMR rat.

812,"Pathogenesis and therapy of peptic ulcer disease.
 The epithelial cells of the stomach and duodenum are normally protected from the damaging effects of acid and pepsin by a balancing mechanism of mucosal resistance.
 If an imbalance occurs, peptic ulcer may result.
 Traditional teaching has emphasized the importance of acid (and pepsin) as the cause of this imbalance; however, it is clear that acid and pepsin are not the only important factors in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer.
 More recent investigative efforts have been directed at what constitutes mucosal resistance and how it can be disrupted to produce, in the presence of gastric acid, a peptic ulcer.
 Depletion of endogenous prostaglandins and Helicobacter pylori gastritis have emerged as prominent theories.
 As evidence exists both to support and refute these theories in humans, any definitive conclusions cannot be made at this time.
 The acute management of peptic ulcer disease is directed at relieving pain, accelerating ulcer healing, and preventing complications.
 Peptic ulcers can be healed with antisecretory agents (i.e., H2-receptor antagonists, omeprazole), antacids, prostaglandins, and sucralfate.
 Because they are effective, safe, and convenient, the H2-receptor antagonists are the most widely used agents for the management of peptic ulcer disease.
 Because the H2-receptor antagonist agents are equally effective in their indicated uses and are equally safe based on scientifically valid data, selection should be based primarily on cost.
 Omeprazole is the newest antisecretory agent: a single morning dose of 20 mg suppresses acid secretion for 24 h.
 The agent offers little advantage over H2-receptor antagonists for the majority of patients with peptic ulcer.

715,"Albumin absorption and protein secretion by the gallbladder in man and in the pig.
 To study albumin absorption by the gallbladder in man, an in vitro model was first established in the pig and compared with in vivo function in the same species.
 Water and electrolyte transport and 125I-albumin absorption and protein secretion in vivo and in vitro were compared.
 Then similar in vitro studies were performed on human gallbladders obtained at surgery.
 The in vivo study in the pig was performed without disturbing the gallbladder except to tie a cannula in the cystic duct end.
 The in vitro model was identical in the pig and human gallbladders.
 Gallbladders were excised using a technique causing minimal injury and anoxia.
 They were oxygenated on both mucosal and serosal surfaces in a temperature-controlled environment.
 Luminal and external bath test solutions consisted of modified Ringers bicarbonate with added glucose; luminal solutions also contained 125I-albumin from different species, depending on the study.
 Active absorption of sodium and water occurred in both types of studies in the pig but in vivo absorption rates were considerably greater than in vitro rates.
 Albumin absorption in vivo was substantial; although present in vitro, the absorption of albumin was diminished relatively more than electrolyte transport rates.
 Protein secretion rates into the gallbladder were similar in vitro and in vivo.
 The results of studies in the human gallbladders in vitro were similar to the pig, except albumin absorption was greater.
 Some human gallbladders were obtained from control patients and some from patients with cholesterol gallstones.
 There were no significant differences between the two groups for any of the variables studied; however, the numbers were small and some control gallbladders were not normal gallbladders.

683,"Phospholipids from rat, human, and canine gastric mucosa. Composition and metabolism of molecular classes of phosphatidylcholine.
 To validate a recent proposal that a phospholipid lining with a high content of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine may protect gastric mucosa against luminal acid, it was decided to study composition and metabolism of phospholipids in the gastric mucosa.
 Phospholipids were analyzed in rat, human, and dog gastric mucosal surface tissue and in a chloroform/methanol-lavage of rat and canine stomach.
 Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were the main components.
 Saturated fatty acids were almost exclusively esterified at the sn-1 position of the glycerol moiety of phosphatidylcholine, and unsaturated fatty acids mainly at the sn-2 position.
 The disaturated class of phosphatidylcholine comprised 2%-6% of total phosphatidylcholine.
 Precursors of phosphatidylcholine, i.e., [32P]orthophosphate and [methyl-14C]choline, were preferentially incorporated into the disaturated molecular class 0.5-6 hours after IV administration.
 It can be speculated that disaturated phosphatidylcholine, although quantitatively a minor component, is specifically triggered in mucosal renewal processes.

776,"Binding to human jejunum of serum IgA antibody from children with coeliac disease.
 Jejunal histology and the presence of serum IgA antibodies (JAB) binding to human jejunum in vitro were studied in 139 children with severe malabsorptive symptoms.
 Among 33 children with confirmed coeliac disease (ESPGAN criteria), 13 (93%) of 14 sampled before starting on a gluten-free diet had JAB, none of 21 sampled had JAB while on a gluten-free diet of long duration, and 90% of 30 sampled during gluten challenge had JAB.
 53 children had severe jejunal villous atrophy (probable coeliac disease): 71% of those younger than 2 years and 94% of those aged 2-18 years had JAB during gluten intake.
 JAB could not be detected in 53 disease control patients (normal jejunal histology) and in 3 coeliac disease patients with selective IgA deficiency.
 Simultaneous determination of antigliadin (AGA) and antiendomysium (EMA) levels, and gliadin and tissue absorption studies, showed that JAB and AGA are different, whereas JAB and EMA are probably identical.
 IgA JAB could be the target-organ-related autoantibodies in coeliac disease.

705,"Duodenal ulcer is associated with low dietary linoleic acid intake.
 It has been suggested that the falling incidence and virulence of duodenal ulcer is related to increased dietary polyunsaturated essential fatty acid intake.
 The adipose fatty acid profile, which closely reflects dietary intake, was measured in 35 men with chronic duodenal ulcer and 35 matched control men.
 The mean percentage of linoleic acid in adipose tissue was significantly lower in the ulcer group (10.0 (0.7) v 12.3 (0.7)%, p less than 0.01) and this difference was found in both smokers and non-smokers.
 This finding suggests that the diets of duodenal ulcer patients are deficient in linoleic acid and this could be of aetiological importance.

836,"Plasma fatty acid profile in advanced cirrhosis: unsaturation deficit of lipid fractions.
 Fatty acid (FA) profile of plasma total lipids, phospholipids (PL), cholesteryl esters (CE), and triglycerides (TG) were measured in 101 patients with advanced liver cirrhosis and in 44 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.
 Plasma levels of lipidic phosphorus, esterified cholesterol, and TG also were measured, and the unsaturation index (UI) was calculated for each fraction.
 Total plasma concentrations of saturated FA, linoleate, and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) were lower in cirrhotics than in controls.
 This profile was also found in plasma levels of PL- and CE-associated FA.
 No detectable amounts of C20:3n9 were found in cirrhotic patients.
 Percent FA distribution of lipid fractions showed a lower percentage of linoleate and PUFA and a higher relative amount of saturated and monoenoic FA in cirrhotics than in controls.
 As a consequence, the UI of PL and CE was diminished in liver cirrhosis.
 Linoleate and PUFA deficiency was more marked in CE than in PL, as shown by the number of patients with values below the 5th percentile of the control group, suggesting an attempt to maintain the unsaturation of PL as the most important component of cell membranes.
 Hepatic failure, poor essential FA intake, and malnutrition are some of the possible etiologic factors for PUFA deficiency in cirrhosis.
 Their relative contribution to plasma FA abnormalities, as well as the clinical and pathophysiological consequences of PUFA deficit in cirrhotic patients, requires further investigation.

748,"Glucose disposal, beta-cell secretion, and hepatic insulin extraction in cirrhosis: a minimal model assessment.
 Factors controlling glucose metabolism after IV load were studied in nine patients with compensated cirrhosis and in six age-matched controls.
 The time courses of glucose, insulin, and C peptide were analyzed by means of the minimal model technique.
 In cirrhosis, insulin sensitivity was reduced by approximately 70% and glucose-dependent glucose uptake (glucose effectiveness) by 45%.
 Decreased glucose effectiveness explained 65% of the variance of glucose disappearance and correlated with the ratio of urinary creatinine to height, an independent measure of muscle mass (r = 0.839).
 beta-cell responsiveness to glucose, measured on C-peptide kinetics, was variable and increased on average by 170% and 107% (first-phase and second-phase, respectively).
 The total amount of insulin secreted by beta-cells in the course of the study was nearly doubled, whereas the basal insulin secretion rate was in the normal range.
 The time courses of hepatic extraction of insulin did not differ between groups, and basal extraction was on average 58% in controls and 56% in patients with cirrhosis.
 It was reduced to 30% in a single patient who had severe hepatocellular failure and large spontaneous portosystemic shunting.
 We conclude that the alterations in glucose metabolism of cirrhosis include a decreased insulin sensitivity, a reduced glucose effectiveness, and an increased pancreatic responsiveness to glucose, leading to hyperinsulinemia.
 The hepatic extraction of insulin is reduced only in the very advanced stages of the disease, possibly because of a large reserve capacity of the hepatic parenchyma.

 At present, the diagnosis of periodontal disease requires a clinical evaluation of the patient including visual findings, the use of the periodontal probe, and radiographs.
 No test is available to evaluate disease activity.

868,"Secondary correction of the unilateral cleft lip nose using a conchal composite graft.
 The secondary deformity of the unilateral cleft lip nose has many components.
 One is the dorsal dislocation of the lateral crus of the alar cartilage.
 We used a conchal composite graft positioned between the piriform aperture and the lateral crus and the upper lateral cartilage to correct this dislocation in nine patients.
 We believe that this graft is effective because it elevates the lateral crus of the alar cartilage off the depressed piriform aperture.
 This technique is very simple to perform, and it is easy to achieve nasal symmetry.
 Our results have been quite satisfactory, with no recurrence of dorsal dislocation.
 The donor site was covered by a subcutaneous pedicled flap from the cephaloauricular sulcus, leaving an inconspicuous deformity.

953,"Determination of serum concentrations of type III procollagen peptide in mechanically ventilated patients. Pronounced augmented concentrations in the adult respiratory distress syndrome.
 Type III procollagen peptide (PCP) is a byproduct of type III collagen synthesis and a potential marker of collagen secretion.
 In chronic diffuse interstitial lung diseases, elevated PCP concentrations have been found in serum as well as in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
 It has been proposed that PCP is a marker of early, active stages of fibrosis.
 As severe fibrosis is a frequent complication in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we investigated PCP in patients with ARDS and compared the results with those from patients requiring mechanical ventilation because of heart failure and after neurosurgical and surgical interventions, and those from spontaneously breathing patients, including healthy volunteers and patients with pneumonia, liver cirrhosis, and renal failure.
 PCP concentrations in patients with ARDS were extremely elevated compared with those in control subjects (p less than 0.001) and correlated positively with FiO2 (r = 0.71, p less than 0.01).
 These results support the pathophysiologic concept of early fibrogenesis in ARDS.
 As preventing pulmonary fibrosis in ARDS is essential in improving survival rate, we believe PCP can be a valuable diagnostic tool in ARDS.

913,"Identification of somatostatin receptors in human small cell lung carcinoma.
 Biopsy specimens obtained from eight patients with lung cancer were tested for content of somatostatin receptors by autoradiography.
 Somatostatin receptors were detected in two of three patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) but in none of five patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) including adenocarcinoma (two), squamous cell carcinoma (two), and bronchoalveolar carcinoma (one).
 In those with SCLC, specific somatostatin receptor binding was evidenced only in tumor foci and not in surrounding stroma or normal lung parenchyma.
 Further tissue characterization by immunoperoxidase staining with the pancytokeratin monoclonal antibody, mAB-lu-5, revealed labeling to all of the NSCLC but to none of the SCLC specimen.
 Selective immunoreactivity was detected in both the SCLC and the NSCLC specimen to chromogranin and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) whereas none of the specimen had detectable immunostaining to somatostatin, bombesin, serotonin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, neurofilament, calcitonin, and synaptophysin.
 The identification of somatostatin receptors in primary human lung cancer may have a bearing on the biology of this disease and perhaps on the clinical application of somatostatin analogues in patients with SCLC.

960,"Tracheal reconstruction with polytetrafluoroethylene graft in dogs.
 Use of prosthetic materials for long-segment tracheal reconstruction has been limited owing to infection, graft migration, ingrowth of fibrous tissue, and stenosis.
 Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is flexible and porous, and it may resist infection more than previously used materials.
 We evaluated PTFE for use in long-segment tracheal reconstruction.
 A 5-cm segment of trachea was resected in 9 dogs and replaced with a 20-mm reinforced PTFE graft using 4-0 Vicryl sutures.
 In 2 control dogs, one tracheal arch was resected and a primary anastomosis was performed.
 The animals were followed up with weekly bronchoscopy and endoscopic photography.
 Euthanasia was performed at 16 weeks or when signs of respiratory distress developed.
 At postmorten examination, the anastomoses were examined grossly and with light and scanning electron microscopy.
 In all 9 dogs that underwent tracheal replacement with PTFE, granulation tissue developed at the anastomoses resulting in airway obstruction after 3 to 8 weeks.
 No epithelial growth occurred over the graft between the anastomoses.
 The control animals did well.
 We conclude that granulation tissue formation at the anastomosis and the lack of respiratory epithelial ingrowth across the graft makes PTFE unsuitable for long-segment tracheal reconstruction.

962,"Glucocorticoids inhibit neurogenic plasma extravasation and prevent virus-potentiated extravasation in the rat trachea.
 Capsaicin increases the permeability of blood vessels in the rat tracheal mucosa through a mechanism involving the release of tachykinins from sensory nerves.
 This capsaicin-induced increase in vascular permeability is potentiated by viral infections of the respiratory tract.
 The present study was done to determine whether this ""neurogenic plasma extravasation"" can be inhibited by glucocorticoids, to learn the time course of this inhibition, and to determine whether glucocorticoids can prevent the potentiating effect of viral respiratory infections on neurogenic plasma extravasation.
 Groups of pathogen-free F344 rats were treated with dexamethasone for 2 or 8 h (4 mg/kg i.p.) or 48 or 120 h (0.5-4 mg/kg per d i.p.).
 Another group of rats was treated with dexamethasone for 120 h following the intranasal inoculation of Sendai virus.
 The magnitude of plasma extravasation produced by capsaicin or substance P was assessed after this treatment by using Monastral blue pigment and Evans blue dye as intravascular tracers.
 We found that dexamethasone reduced, in a dose-dependent fashion, the magnitude of plasma extravasation produced in the rat trachea by capsaicin and substance P.
 Significant inhibition was produced by a dose of dexamethasone as small as 0.5 mg/kg i.p.
 The effect of dexamethasone had a latency of several hours and reached a maximum after 2 d of treatment.
 Furthermore, dexamethasone prevented the potentiation of neurogenic plasma extravasation usually present after 5 d of Sendai virus respiratory infection.

896,"Plasma cross linked fibrin degradation products in pulmonary embolism.
 Plasma concentrations of cross linked fibrin degradation products, a marker of intravascular thrombosis and fibrinolysis, were measured in 495 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism referred for ventilation-perfusion lung scanning to determine whether concentrations are increased in pulmonary embolism and their potential use in diagnosis.
 Lung scans were described as normal (n = 66) or as showing a low (n = 292), indeterminate (n = 58), or high probability (n = 79) of pulmonary embolism.
 There was a difference between the mean levels of cross linked fibrin degradation products in each scan category: normal scans, 142 ng/ml; low probability scans, 295 ng/ml; indeterminate probability scans, 510 ng/ml; high probability scans, 952 ng/ml (p less than 0.001).
 Of the patients with high probability scans, 96% had raised concentrations.
 Explanations for discrepant low results include incorrect scan diagnosis, delay in blood sampling, and anticoagulation.
 Of the patients with a low or indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism, 43% had increased concentrations of cross linked fibrin degradation products that could be attributed in most cases to another illness.
 Owing to the wide range of values in each lung scan diagnostic category, raised concentrations of these fibrin degradation products cannot be used without reference to the patient's clinical state as a discriminatory test for pulmonary embolism.
 Further evaluation of the significance of normal concentrations in excluding a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism appears to be warranted.

981,"Inhibition of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction by MK-571, a potent leukotriene D4-receptor antagonist 
 BACKGROUND.
 Exercise is a common stimulus of bronchoconstriction in subjects with asthma, who also have bronchoconstriction after inhaling the sulfidopeptide leukotriene D4 (LTD4).
 The purpose of this study was to investigate the importance of LTD4 as a mediator of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.
 METHODS.
 In a double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 12 subjects with stable asthma were treated intravenously with MK-571 (160 mg), a selective and potent LTD4-receptor antagonist, or placebo, 20 minutes before each of two challenges involving exercise at a level previously demonstrated to cause a fall of at least 20 percent in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).
 The two exercise challenges were separated by one week.
 The results of the challenges were expressed as both the maximal fall in FEV1 after exercise and the time to recovery from bronchoconstriction.
 RESULTS.
 Treatment with MK-571 attenuated exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in all the subjects.
 The mean (+/- SEM) maximal percent decrease in FEV1 after exercise was 25.2 +/- 3.5 percent in the subjects taking placebo and 9.2 +/- 2.5 percent in the subjects taking MK-571 (P less than 0.001).
 The mean percent inhibition for the entire group was 69.5 percent.
 The mean time to recovery after exercise was 33.4 +/- 4.0 minutes in the placebo group and 8.4 +/- 2.5 minutes in the MK-571 group (P less than 0.001).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 This study demonstrates that pretreatment with a potent and selective LTD4 antagonist markedly attenuates exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and it suggests that LTD4 is a major mediator of this type of bronchoconstriction.

977,"Altered function of pulmonary surfactant in fatty acid lung injury.
 To determine whether acute fatty acid lung injury impairs pulmonary surfactant function, we studied anesthetized ventilated rabbits given oleic acid (55 mg/kg iv, n = 11) or an equivalent volume of saline (n = 8).
 Measurements of pulmonary mechanics indicated a decrease in dynamic compliance within 5 min of injury and a decrease in lung volume that was disproportionately large at low pressures, consistent with diminished surfactant activity in vivo.
 Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained 1 h after injury had significantly increased erythrocytes and total leukocytes, largely polymorphonuclear cells.
 The phospholipid content and composition of the cell-free fraction had only minor changes from those of controls, but the protein content was increased 35-fold.
 Measurements of lavage surface activity in vitro showed an increase in average minimum surface tension from 1.3 +/- 0.4 (SE) dyn/cm in controls to 20.2 +/- 3.9 dyn/cm in injured animals.
 The alterations in static pressure-volume curves and decrease in lavage surface activity suggest a severe alteration of surfactant function in this form of lung injury that occurs despite the presence of normal amounts of surfactant phospholipids.

928,"Platelet-activating factor- and leukotriene B4-induced release of lactoferrin from blood neutrophils of atopic and nonatopic individuals.
 We found increased accumulation of neutrophils and their components, lactoferrin (Lf) and elastase, as well as platelet-activating factor (PAF) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) at sites of ongoing human allergic reactions.
 To determine whether PAF or LTB4, could be the stimulus for in vivo Lf release, blood neutrophils of 17 subjects were incubated with PAF, LTB4, or the phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and the released Lf (ELISA assay) was compared with spontaneous release.
 Significantly increased Lf release was induced by PAF, 10(-5) to 10(-8) mol/L (p less than 0.002); LTB4, 10(-7) to 10(-8) mol/L (p less than 0.004); and PMA (0.05 micrograms/ml) in a dose-dependent reaction.
 Cytochalasin was not required for Lf secretion but did enhance such responses.
 PAF-induced Lf secretion was inhibited by the specific PAF antagonist, BN 52063.
 More Lf was released from neutrophils of atopic than from nonatopic subjects in response to PAF, 10(-6) mol/L (4.2 micrograms/ml +/- 0.2 versus 2.6 micrograms/ml +/- 0.2; p less than 0.001) but not to LTB4, PMA, or buffer (p, not significant).
 We conclude that (1) PAF and LTB4 released in vivo could stimulate local neutrophils to release Lf with possible pathogenic effects and (2) neutrophils of atopic subjects are more responsive to PAF than neutrophils of nonatopic subjects in this regard.

922,"Real and pseudo late asthmatic reactions after submaximal exercise challenge in patients with bronchial asthma. A new definition for late asthmatic responses after exercise challenge.
 The late asthmatic reaction after exercise challenge remains a controversial issue.
 In this study, 21 patients recorded peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) on two control days without performing exercise.
 There was no difference between both control days when PEFR at 1 h was compared with baseline PEFR and when PEFR at 4 to 13 hours was compared with baseline PEFR.
 After analyzing variation coefficients of baseline PEFR on a control day and exercise day, PEFR was not allowed to differ more than 15.3 percent in the same patient when comparing exercise day and control day for the late fall in PEFR in the study.
 In 17 of 81 patients, a late asthmatic reaction after exercise challenge was present when PEFR fall was greater than or equal to 20 percent compared with baseline PEFR value.
 In eight of the 17 patients, a real late asthmatic reaction to exercise challenge was present with a PEFR fall greater than or equal to 20 percent on at least three successive time points and who had a PEFR fall greater than or equal to 20 percent compared with corresponding clocktime on a control day.
 The late asthmatic reaction to exercise challenge is characterized not as a nonspecific epiphenomenon, but as a fall in PEFR of greater than or equal to 20 percent compared with baseline PEFR value and with corresponding clocktime on a control day on at least three successive time points.

908,"Selection factors resulting in improved survival after surgical resection of tumors metastatic to the lungs.
 From 1973 through 1987, a total of 140 patients underwent 184 operations for removal of metastatic tumors to the lungs.
 The number of lesions removed ranged form one to 30.
 Of the patients, 44% had solitary lesions.
 Overall 3-year survival was 62.6%, and 5-year survival was 48.2%.
 In all primary tumors except melanoma and breast cancer, 3-year survival was greater than 50% and 5-year survival was greater than 40%.
 With rare exceptions, the operation of choice for unilateral lesions was ipsilateral thoracotomy, and for bilateral lesions it was median sternotomy.
 Adequate conservative resection was the rule.
 There were three pneumonectomies, 25 lobectomies, 71 single wedge resections, 38 multiple unilateral wedge resections, and 47 bilateral wedge resections.
 There were no postoperative hospital deaths.
 Cox covariate analysis demonstrated improved survival in patients whose largest lesion was less than 1.5 cm in diameter and with disease-free interval longer than 1 year, but survival was not related to number of lesions or age of patient.
 An aggressive surgical approach is justified in patients with most primary tumors and a limited number of lung metastases less than 1.5 cm in diameter.
 Resection of metastases from melanoma and breast cancer should be accomplished after other sites of metastatic disease have been ruled out by the most stringent criteria.

1000,"Aqueous beclomethasone diproprionate nasal spray: regular versus ""as required"" use in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
 OBJECTIVE: to determine the effect of alternative regimens of nasal steroid administration on symptoms and quality of life.
 DESIGN: randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparison.
 SUBJECTS: sixty ragweed-sensitive adults recruited from participants of previous studies and through media advertising.
 INTERVENTIONS: 200 micrograms of aqueous beclomethasone diproprionate nasal spray, twice daily, from 1 week before until 1 week after the ragweed-pollen season (regular) or 100 micrograms of the spray, taken as required, up to 400 micrograms daily; troublesome nasal symptoms were treated, in both groups, by increasing the daily dose to 800 micrograms until symptoms were controlled.
 If this treatment was insufficient, 120 mg of terfenadine, daily, was added.
 RESULTS: One subject in the ""as required""-treated group withdrew with uncontrolled nasal symptoms.
 In the remaining subjects, sneezing, stuffy nose, and rhinorrhea, measured by a daily diary, were significantly better controlled in the regular-treated group (p less than 0.025).
 Impairment of quality of life, including sleep disturbance, nonhay fever symptoms, practical problems, and uncomfortable emotions were greater in the as required-treated group (p less than 0.001).
 Subjects in the regular-treated group required less additional terfenadine (0.27 tablets per subject versus 1.40; p = 0.022).
 Eye symptoms and eye-drop use were similar in the two treated groups.
 CONCLUSION: In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, regular use of inhaled steroids results in fewer symptoms and better quality of life than when the spray is taken only as required.

1029,"Bilateral semicircular canal aplasia with near-normal cochlear development. Two case reports.
 Congenital malformations of the vestibular labyrinth (pars superior) are rare.
 We present two patients with computed tomographic findings of bilateral semicircular canal aplasia with normal or near-normal cochleas.
 Initial bone conduction thresholds were within normal limits, although both patients had significant conductive hearing losses due to congenital middle ear malformations.
 Bithermal caloric responses were absent in both.
 To our knowledge these are the first reports of vestibular aplasia concomitant with normal or near-normal cochlear development.
 These findings conflict with conventional hypotheses that state that inner ear malformations result from arrested development during the normal stages of inner ear embryogenesis.

1031,"The efficacy of oral steroids in the treatment of persistent otitis media with effusion.
 One hundred thirty-six children with otitis media with effusion of at least 2 months' duration were investigated in a strict, double-blind, randomized prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of oral steroids in the treatment of this disease.
 The results of our study showed a significant complete and partial recovery from otitis media with effusion in the group treated by a combination of antibiotics (amoxicillin) and oral steroids (prednisone), compared with an amoxicillin-treated group and a placebo-treated group.
 We believe that this treatment mostly benefits children aged 4 to 10 years without oversized adenoids.
 The findings of our study imply that a combined course of antibiotics and oral steroids deserves its place as a routine conservative trial before surgery.

 Rolling, sitting, and crawling patterns were motoscopically analyzed in 72 children with cerebral palsy and spastic diplegia; the relation between these patterns and the severity of the locomotive disability was studied.
 In rolling, trunk rotation and elbow support were difficult for the most severely diplegic children.
 When sitting, most patients had a between-heel sitting pattern in which the thighs were adducted and the knees were flexed.
 When crawling, the reciprocal thigh movements were insufficient and accompanied by lateral bending of the trunk in many patients.
 In the more impaired patients, the thighs supported the weight in flexion and did not move reciprocally.
 Creeping on the elbows without reciprocal leg movements was demonstrated in the most severely affected children after 2 years of age.

1175,"Effect of normal MSAFP screening on maternal age for genetic amniocentesis.
 Routine maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening for neural tube defects is considered by many to be standard obstetrical care, and recently many have encouraged this test to screen for Trisomy-21 (Down's syndrome).
 We questioned whether, after a normal MSAFP screen, the risk of Trisomy-21 decreases enough to warrant modifying the recommended age for genetic amniocentesis for Down's syndrome.
 A logistic regression was developed which, using reported values for sensitivity and specificity for MSAFP detection of Trisomy-21 and assuming a constant threshold risk in opting for amniocentesis, indicates that genetic amniocentesis for Trisomy-21 may be deferred in some women who have a normal MSAFP screening.
 Sensitivity analysis of varying thresholds for a normal MSAFP demonstrates that a 37 year old woman with a median MSAFP level has the same risk for Trisomy-21 as an unscreened women who is 4.5 years younger.
 An abnormal MSAFP is useful in screening for neural tube defects and possibly for Trisomy-21.
 A normal MSAFP may allow for delaying the potentially risky amniocentesis in otherwise low-risk pregnancies.

1034,"Excitatory amino acids in the developing brain: ontogeny, plasticity, and excitotoxicity.
 Besides their role as neurotransmitters, excitatory amino acids (EAAs) in the developing brain are crucially involved in plasticity and excitotoxicity which are modified by their distinct ontogeny.
 Along with incomplete neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis, presynaptic markers of the EAA system are immature in the developing brain; however, postsynaptic EAA system activities, particularly of the N-methyl-D-aspartate and quisqualate receptors, are transiently enhanced early in life.
 This transient enhancement is presumably beneficial to the immature brain because physiologic activation of the EAA system plays a critical role in plasticity of early learning and morphogenesis.
 At the same time, this transient hypersensitivity renders the immature brain vulnerable to pathologic excitation of the EAA system (excitotoxicity) as observed during neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.

1218,"Quantitative evaluation of hypnotically suggested hyperaesthesia and analgesia by painful laser stimulation.
 The ability to reduce both clinically and experimentally induced pain by hypnotic suggestion of analgesia is well known.
 However, the nature of hypnotic analgesia still remains uncertain.
 Attempts to demonstrate and identify specific psychophysiological mechanisms have, so far, been unsatisfactory.
 Methodological problems in inducing pain and monitoring physiological responses may be the reason for this lack of success.
 In the present study, we have attempted to eliminate some of these methodological problems.
 The sensory and pain thresholds to laser stimulation were determined, and the laser-evoked brain potentials were measured for 8 highly hypnotically susceptible subjects in 3 conditions: (1) waking state, (2) suggestion of hyperaesthesia, (3) suggestion of analgesia.
 The thresholds were reduced during induced hyperaesthesia and increased during analgesia.
 During hyperaesthesia sensations could be evoked by laser intensities which were below intensities that could be perceived in the awake state.
 The amplitude of the evoked brain potentials increased during hyperaesthesia and decreased during analgesia.
 The latency of the potential remained constant.
 The perception of pain during hypnosis can change very fast, indicating that slow endogenous mechanisms may play only a minor role in suggested hyperaesthesia/analgesia.

1104,"Unusual blink reflex with four components in a patient with periodic ataxia.
 Characteristic findings in blink reflex are reported in a 55-year-old female with periodic ataxia.
 The blink reflexes on the side ipsilateral to the stimulation consisted of four components with latencies of 11, 21, 35 and 47 ms, instead of the usual two components seen in normal subjects.
 On the contralateral side, the last three components were also present.
 The second component was different from the normal R2 response in that its latency was shorter than normal and it did not habituate by stimulation at a rate of 10 Hz.
 In addition, it was more affected by diazepam than the third or fourth components.
 It is considered that R2 may have consisted of three components and that a shorter latency of the second component could be explained by facilitation.

1142,"Influence of amphetamine treatment on somatosensory function of the normal and infarcted rat brain.
 The consequences of acute amphetamine administration on the metabolic responsiveness of the cerebral cortex to physiologic activation were studied in normal and infarcted rats.
 Treated rats received a 4 mg/kg intravenous injection of d-amphetamine 1 hour before unilateral vibrissae stimulation and 2-deoxyglucose study.
 In nontreated normal rats, metabolic activation was restricted to the major relay stations of the vibrissae-barrel circuit.
 In amphetamine-treated rats, stimulation-induced increased glucose utilization was widespread, including ipsilateral and contralateral cortical regions outside the barrel field circuit.
 For example, an 84% increase in glucose utilization above control was seen in cortical areas anterior to the barrel field region.
 Increased glucose utilization induced by stimulation was severely depressed in nontreated rats that had undergone infarction of the left cortical barrel field 2 weeks previously.
 Vibrissae stimulation failed to increase glucose utilization significantly in cortical areas remote from the infarct.
 In contrast, bilateral increases in glucose utilization were observed within cortical regions of treated infarcted rats.
 For example, a 50% increase in glucose utilization was detected in cortical areas bordering the infarct.
 Thus, in the normal and infarcted rat, amphetamine appears to promote alternate circuit activation--a pharmacologic property that may be advantageous for recovery after injury.

1132,"Pain in children.
 The assessment and management of children's pain is a topic that has received a great deal of attention since the late 1970s.
 Nurse researchers have played a dominant role in all areas of pediatric pain relief and likely will continue to do so.
 There are currently a number of pediatric pain assessment instruments developed that are used in selected practice settings, but their use should be extended to document the existence of pediatric pain and its relief.
 Pharmacologic interventions for pediatric pain relief have been hampered by incorrect beliefs about analgesic risks, prescribing and administrating habits, and a virtual explosion of information in the area of analgesics.
 Although nurses have traditionally used nonpharmacologic interventions for pain relief, these methods have not been well researched.
 Continued research efforts in this important area will result in improved diagnosis and management of pediatric pain.

1222,"Onset phase of spinal bupivacaine analgesia assessed quantitatively by laser stimulation.
 Analgesia was assessed quantitatively at various dermatomes (C7, T8, T10, T12, L1, L3, S1) for the first 30 min after subarachnoid administration of 0.5% bupivacaine 3.5 ml.
 Stimulation with 10 needles and laser stimulation could evoke pain in dermatomes with adequate analgesia to single needle stimulation.
 Analgesia was assessed by thresholds (sensory and pain) and by pain-related brain potentials (amplitude and latency) to laser stimulation.
 Little analgesia was found at T10, but it increased gradually towards caudal segments.
 The dermatome related to the site of the injection (L3) was not blocked to a greater extent than the surrounding dermatomes.
 Conduction time (the latency of the evoked brain potential) was increased relatively more from the S1 dermatome compared with L1.

1116,"Sensitivity for detecting fibrillation potentials: a comparison between concentric and monopolar needle electrodes.
 The sensitivity of monopolar and concentric electrodes for detecting fibrillation potentials (FP) has never been formally compared.
 We studied 35 muscles with FP, sampling 20 sites each with concentric and monopolar needles.
 The concentric needle identified 0.88 +/- 3.44 (mean +/- standard deviation) more sites with spontaneous activity.
 Although statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed rank test P less than .03), this difference in sensitivity did not appreciably affect diagnostic interpretation.
 Subjects described the concentric needles as more painful.
 Needle insertions in 25 other muscles demonstrated that needle movement generated the majority of FP.
 We suggest that the increased tissue injury caused by concentric needles may account for both their increased sensitivity and discomfort.

 Typical trigeminal neuralgia has occasionally occurred in multiple members of the same family over several generations.

 More rarely, familial trigeminal neuralgia has been described in the setting of hereditary peripheral neuropathy, especially Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
 We describe patients from two different families with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and medically intractable trigeminal neuralgia.

1201,"Lateralized effects of subclinical epileptiform EEG discharges on scholastic performance in children.
 The interaction between lateralization of subclinical epileptiform discharges and cognitive tasks was investigated in 21 children (12 girls and 9 boys, mean age 10.6 years).
 Seventeen had a diagnosis of epilepsy (partial or secondarily generalized).
 Testing was by reading, arithmetic, and intelligence subtests during continuous telemetric EEG and video monitoring.
 Children with left-sided discharges had significantly lower reading performance than children with right-sided discharges.
 During reading, epileptiform discharges occurred relatively less frequently and with a shorter total duration over the left hemisphere than the right.
 This supports the view that cognitive tasks suppress epileptiform discharges when they activate a region of the brain within the epileptogenic zone.
 Discharges from other epileptogenic zones not directly activated by the tasks are increased, however.

1193,"Continuous removal of middle molecules by hemofiltration in patients with acute liver failure.
 In patients with acute liver failure and hepatic coma, an increase in the abnormal ""middle molecules"" seen on the chromatograms of the sera is suspected of playing an etiologic role in the coma.
 A pilot study of continuous hemofiltration using a high-performance membrane was conducted in 16 such patients in an attempt to decrease the serum levels of the middle molecules.
 The procedure was used alternately with plasma exchange.
 High-performance liquid chromatography showed a notable removal of the substances in the filtrates and a sequential removal from the serum by hemofiltration.
 Eight (50%) of the 16 patients had amelioration in level of consciousness and were weaned successfully from hemofiltration.
 Although only three of the 16 patients survived the acute illness, 13 others lived an average of 15 days and five patients survived greater than 3 wk.
 While the continuous removal of middle molecules from the serum may not reverse liver failure, this procedure used in conjunction with plasma exchange may provide a means of life support, e.g., for patients awaiting a liver transplant.

 One hundred adult day-case patients who required intravenous access had cannulae inserted using local anaesthesia with 1% lignocaine, 1% lignocaine with adrenaline or the corresponding pH-adjusted solutions.
 The local anaesthetic solutions were modified by the addition of 1 ml 8.4% sodium bicarbonate to 10 ml lignocaine.
 Pain scores at different stages of cannulation were noted and showed a significant reduction after use of pH-adjusted solutions (p less than 0.02 for the plain lignocaine, and less than 0.001 for the lignocaine with adrenaline).
 Modification of the pH of lignocaine solutions by the addition of sodium bicarbonate is a simple method significantly to reduce the discomfort caused by the infiltration of the local anaesthetic.

1143,"Effects of MK-801 on recovery from sensorimotor cortex lesions.
 Histologic evidence suggests that drugs acting as noncompetitive antagonists at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor can have beneficial or pathologic effects on central nervous system neurons.
 In the present experiments we examined the effects of MK-801 on recovery of behavioral function after unilateral lesions in the rat somatic sensorimotor cortex.
 In the first experiment, rats with unilateral sensorimotor cortex lesions were given either MK-801 (1 mg/kg) or saline 12-16 hours after surgery.
 Additional injections were given on postoperative days 2, 4, and 6.
 Behavioral tests measured somatosensory asymmetries (i.e., bilateral tactile stimulation tests) and forelimb placing.
 After creation of sensorimotor cortex lesions, rats showed an ipsilateral somatosensory bias and an impairment in placing the contralateral forelimb.
 Rats treated with MK-801 recovered slightly faster than saline-treated animals as measured by a bilateral tactile stimulation test (p less than 0.05).
 In contrast, there was no significant difference between the groups in the recovery of forelimb placing.
 In a second experiment, rats with sensorimotor cortex lesions were treated with a single injection of MK-801 after behavioral recovery.
 Twenty hours after the MK-801 injection, rats with sensorimotor cortex lesions showed a reinstatement of the placing deficits.
 The impairment endured for at least 7 days after injection.
 These behavioral data support the idea that MK-801 can have either beneficial or detrimental effects when administered after brain damage.

 A review of 50 TKAs using a condylar prosthesis and a standardized technique for patellar resurfacing was performed to evaluate the accuracy of the technique.
 The patients were evaluated at a mean of 2.5 years (range, two to five years) after surgery.
 The Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Score improved from a preoperative mean of 56 to 92 at the last evaluation.
 The Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Scores were excellent in 92% and good in 8%.

 The association of reactive oxygen species to altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier in acute experimental encephalomyelitis was investigated by ultrastructural cytochemical localization of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to sites in the optic nerve previously identified by extravasation of intravascular horseradish peroxidase.
 Using a modified cerium method, we found electron-dense cerium-derived H2O2 reaction product was localized to the perivascular space at the lamina retinalis, lamina choroidalis, and lamina scleralis.
 In the optic nerve head, electron-dense reaction product was observed in the presence of intravascular leukocytes, although adjacent perivascular and interstitial inflammatory cells at this site were scant.
 In the myelinated retrobulbar optic nerve, cerium-derived H2O2 reaction product was seen in the intravascular space of blood vessels and surrounding perivascular and interstitial foci of inflammatory cells.
 Reaction product was also observed in the extracellular space adjacent to the plasmalemma of axons and glial cells in the optic nerve head and retrobulbar nerve.
 The perivascular and intravascular distribution of cerium-derived reaction product suggests that H2O2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of altered vascular permeability in experimental optic neuritis and supports our previous observations of suppression of blood-brain barrier permeability by detoxification of H2O2 with the exogenous administration of antioxidant enzymes.

 We performed 9 to 12 mm of recession of the superior oblique tendon for A-pattern strabismus in 10 patients.
 The average preoperative A-pattern measured 29.4 prism dioptres (PD), and the average pattern correction was 29.3 PD.
 All patients had a residual pattern of 6 PD or less (average 2.3 PD).
 No patient experienced significant underaction of the superior oblique, and other surgical complications, such as ptosis, Brown's syndrome, and laceration of the vortex vein or superior rectus, did not occur.
 The procedure corrected 14 to 40 PD of A-pattern.
 The amount of pattern corrected was correlated with the size of the preoperative A-pattern but not with the total amount of recession done.
 No significant shift in esodeviation in primary position was noted in the patients who underwent only superior oblique recession.
 The procedure appears to be of particular value in patients with moderate superior oblique overaction.
 The advantages of recession of the superior oblique tendon include the potential for reversibility and reoperation, low risk of induced superior oblique palsy, allowance for asymmetric surgery and potential for adjustable suture technique.

1313,"Transrectal ultrasonography for the early detection and staging of prostate cancer.
 Relatively recent changes and improvements in equipment have vastly increased image resolution for transrectal ultrasonography of the prostate.
 The expanded use of transrectal ultrasonography has greatly furthered knowledge of prostate zonal anatomy and permitted clinical evaluation of internal prostate architecture.
 The technique is operator dependent, as the quality of the results is related directly to that person's knowledge and experience.
 The significant majority of prostate cancers originate from the peripheral zone.
 Palpable stage B nodules characteristically have a hypoechoic appearance.
 There is disagreement about the tumor characteristics that cause hypoechogenicity, but large tumors may obscure the normal prostate anatomy and appear isoechoic because of the lack of contrast with surrounding prostate tissue.
 The transition zone of the prostate is the origin of benign prostatic hyperplasia and almost 20 per cent of prostate cancers.
 These tumors probably correspond to most stage A lesions.
 Transrectal ultrasonography is less accurate in identifying transition zone tumors because of the mixed echogenicity of the transition zone, interference from prostatic calculi or calcified corpora amylacea, and poorer image resolution in this area.
 Studies evaluating the use of transrectal ultrasonography for early detection of prostate cancer generally have shown a twofold increase in the detection rate compared with digital rectal examination.
 However, the decreased morbidity and expense of transrectal prostate biopsy using an automatic gun device have increased the frequency of biopsy in ultrasound-examined patients compared with those historically evaluated by digital rectal examination.
 The increased detection rate may in part be a function of the increased use of biopsies, independent of other factors.
 Transrectal ultrasonography rarely detects cancer in patient with normal digital rectal examination and a normal serum prostate-specific antigen level.
 Transrectal ultrasonography may be capable of identifying early capsular penetration or seminal vesicle invasion in some patients with known prostate cancer.
 However, its superiority to digital rectal examination for this purpose has not been demonstrated unequivocally.
 Ultrasonography does allow directed biopsies of the seminal vesicles or other suspect areas, and this may be helpful in staging the disease.
 The use of transrectal ultrasonography in prostate cancer has evolved rapidly, and changes in technology antiquate reports within a few years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

1385,"Whole bladder photodynamic therapy: critical review of present-day technology and rationale for development of intravesical laser catheter and monitoring system.
 Present-day whole bladder photodynamic therapy (WBPDT) is cumbersome and time consuming because cystoscopic and ultrasonic manipulations are necessary to position the light emitter within the bladder.
 More important, WBPDT is inherently unsafe and often ineffective since neither uniform photoirradiation nor accurate light dosimetry can be achieved with the techniques employed to photoirradiate the bladder wall.
 The intravesical laser catheter (IVLC) eliminates the need for cystoscopy and ultrasonography because passage of the treatment fiber into the catheter's central lumen automatically positions its light-diffusing tip within the center of the bladder.
 Use of the IVLC delivery system also assures accurate photoirradiation of the bladder wall since inflation of the catheter's balloon transforms the asymmetric bladder into a sphere of known diameter.
 The light sensor incorporated in the balloon wall provides a method to monitor light fluence and measure total light dose.
 When provided the parameters of bladder volume, laser energy output, and desired light dose, the computerized control system calculates treatment time and automatically adjusts the period of photoirradiation to compensate for variations in laser light production, energy losses during transmission, and for variations in light intensity resulting from the integrating sphere effect of the bladder wall.
 This delivery system also increases the safety of WBPDT since the monitor automatically discontinues treatment if any unsafe situation, with respect to light fluence, develops during photoirradiation.

1431,"Phenotypic characterization of monocytes and macrophages from CAPD patients.
 The purpose of this study was to phenotypically characterize and compare peripheral blood monocytes from CAPD patients with peritoneal macrophages isolated from their peritoneal dialysis effluents.
 Monocytes/macrophages were labeled with fluorescent ligands or monoclonal antibodies specific for 1) receptors for C5a, formyl-met-leu-phe (fMLP); Fc region of IgG; C3b (CR1); and C3bi (CR3), 2) Class II histocompatibility antigens HLA-DR and HLA-DQ; and 3) monocyte/macrophage surface antigen CD14.
 The cells were analyzed using flow cytometry.
 Results indicated that there were no differences between monocytes and peritoneal macrophages in their receptor expression for fMLP, CR1, or CR3.
 However, paired t-testing indicated that peritoneal macrophages had significantly increased expression of Fc and C5a receptors, as well as enhanced antigen expression of HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and CD14.
 These results suggest that peritoneal macrophages from CAPD patients are activated with increased expression of receptors and antigens important in host defense.

 Racial differences in the risk of cancer of the urinary bladder associated with cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption were examined in a study of 1663 cases (1534 whites and 129 blacks) and 4930 controls matched 3:1 by sex, race, and age to the cases.
 Significant increases in cancer risk associated with cigarette smoking were observed in whites and blacks; however, the dose-response patterns appeared to differ by race.
 In whites, statistically significant elevations of threefold and higher were observed in the odds ratios at all smoking levels above 20 pack-years, whereas in blacks, the corresponding point estimates did not increase significantly until greater than 60 pack-years of smoking.
 Although these risk patterns are compatible with the higher incidence of bladder cancer in white men, the sample of blacks was small, and tests of significance were only suggestive of higher risks for whites at specific amounts of smoking (P less than 0.15).
 Effects of alcohol consumption were inconsistent, and there was no detectable synergism between smoking and drinking.

 On the other hand, all synthetic polymer membrane dialyzers had adsorptive properties, and in a dialyzer with a polymethylmethacrylate membrane, a large amount of BMG was removed by adsorption alone.
 Dialyzers with cellulose triacetate and polyacrylonitril membranes showed higher values of BMG diffusive dialysance (greater than 20 ml/min) and sieving coefficient (greater than 0.9).
 From in vitro experiments using an aqueous solution containing several solutes with relatively small or middle molecular weights, all HPM dialyzers had a higher overall mass transfer coefficient than any conventional membrane dialyzer.

1308,"The absence of nephrotoxicity and differential nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin.
 We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial of gentamicin and tobramycin to evaluate differences in nephrotoxicity.
 We evaluated levels of creatinine, creatinine clearance, beta 2-microglobulin, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) as indicators of nephrotoxicity, and attempted to correlate them.
 Forty patients met the criteria for evaluation; 14 were given tobramycin and the remaining 26 received gentamicin.
 Significant nephrotoxicity, as defined by an increase in creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, did not occur in either group.
 Increases in beta 2-microglobulin values were seen in 67% of the patients in the tobramycin group, and 52% of those in the gentamicin group.
 Elevations in NAG levels occurred in 54% of those in the tobramycin group and 52% of those in the gentamicin group.
 Elevation of NAG and beta 2-microglobulin levels was congruent in only 40% of the cases.
 We conclude that there was no significant difference in nephrotoxicity between gentamicin and tobramycin.
 Elevations of NAG and beta 2-microglobulin occurred at rates similar to those reported in the literature, but they did not correlate with significant nephrotoxicity.

1446,"Enhancing effect of partial cystectomy on rat urinary bladder carcinogenesis.
 The effects of 5% and 50% partial cystectomies on bladder tumorigenesis initiated with N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine(BBN) were investigated in Wistar rats by examining the histological findings and cell proliferative activity.
 The incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into the DNA synthesis phase was determined by an in-vitro labeling technique.
 After eight weeks of treatment with drinking water containing 0.05% BBN, 5% or 50% partial cystectomy was performed at the end of week 16, and the resected bladder was sutured with dexon or silk.
 There was no difference in the incidence of papillary or nodular (PN) hyperplasia between the control and partial cystectomy groups.
 However, the incidence of cancer in the group given partial cystectomy was much higher than that in the control.
 All the cancers in the control group were grade-1 superficial tumors, whereas grade-2 or invasive tumor was observed in six of 40 animals in the partial cystectomy group.
 The 31.0% labeling index of cancer in the partial cystectomy group was greater than the 24.1% in the control group.
 There was also a significant difference in the number of BrdUrd-labeled cells in PN hyperplasia between the control and partial cystectomy groups.
 These findings indicate that partial cystectomy enhances BBN-initiated bladder carcinogenesis and the increase in DNA synthesis found in PN hyperplasia and cancer may be associated with the induction of bladder tumors.

1298,"Uremic platelets have a functional defect affecting the interaction of von Willebrand factor with glycoprotein IIb-IIIa.
 Uremic patients have an impaired platelet function that has been related to membrane glycoprotein (GP) abnormalities.
 Using a perfusion system, we have studied the interaction of normal and uremic platelets with vessel subendothelium (SE) under flow conditions.
 Reconstituted blood containing washed platelets, purified von Willebrand factor (vWF) (1 U/mL), and normal washed red blood cells was exposed to de-endothelialized rabbit segments for 10 minutes at two different shear rates (800 and 1,600 seconds-1).
 In some experiments a monoclonal antibody to the GPIIb-IIIa complex (EDU3) was added to the perfusates.
 With normal platelets, the percentage of the vessel covered by platelets (%CS) was 23.1% +/- 3.7% at 800 seconds-1 and 30% +/- 4.3% at 1,600 seconds-1.
 Platelets were observed in contact or forming monolayers on vessel SE.
 EDU3 inhibited the spreading of normal platelets.
 The %CS (11.1% +/- 3.3%) was statistically decreased (P less than .01) and most of the platelets were observed in contact with the vessel surface.
 These data indicate that, under flow conditions, the interaction of vWF with GPIIb-IIIa can support the spreading of normal platelets in the absence of exogenous fibrinogen.
 Under the same experimental conditions, the interaction of uremic platelets with SE was markedly impaired at both shear rates studied (P less than .01 v normal platelets).
 The presence of EDU3 did not modify the interaction of uremic platelets.
 These results confirm the impairment of the platelet adhesion observed in uremic patients.
 Furthermore, they indicate the presence of a functional defect in the interaction of vWF with GPIIb-IIIa.
 The fact that perfusions with normal and uremic platelets in the presence of an antibody to the GPIIb-IIIa complex did not show any differences gives indirect evidence on a functionally normal interaction vWF/GPIb in uremic patients.

 To understand better the epidemiology and to describe the causes of maternal death, we reviewed all identified maternal deaths in the United States and Puerto Rico for 1979-1986.
 The overall maternal mortality ratio for the period was 9.1 deaths per 100,000 live births.
 The ratios increased with age and were higher among women of black and other minority races than among white women for all age groups.
 The causes of death varied for different outcomes of pregnancy; pulmonary embolism was the leading cause of death after a live birth.
 Unmarried women had a higher risk of death than married women.
 The risk of death increased with increasing live-birth order, except for primiparas.
 In order to develop strategies to reduce the risk of maternal death in the United States, future studies should include expanded information about each death, which will allow better understanding of factors associated with maternal mortality.

1543,"Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) in women with bicornuate uteri.
 Fourteen women with bicornuate uteri underwent a total of 30 gamete intrafallopian transfer procedures.
 All patients responded adequately to ovarian stimulation.
 Eight women conceived, two of them twice.
 Five women delivered at term and three had a premature delivery.
 There was one spontaneous abortion and an ectopic pregnancy.
 No neonatal deaths occurred in this series.
 No increase in the incidence of spontaneous abortion was noted but there appeared to be an increase in the incidence of premature labor.
 These findings suggest that the prospects of conception for infertile women with bicornuate uteri treated with gamete intrafallopian transfer are similar to those of the rest of the infertile population treated at our center.

1542,"The value of hysteroscopy in elderly women prior to in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET): a comparative study.
 Two hundred eighty-four hysteroscopies were performed in 312 (91%) candidates for in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) who were divided into two groups.
 Group I consisted of elderly women over 40 years, and group II of women below this age.
 Although visualization revealed uterine abnormalities in 29.9% of all patients, abnormal findings were significantly increased in the former group in comparison to the latter (P less than 0.001).
 This difference was attributed mainly to uterine rather than cervical pathology.
 Furthermore, in elderly women age-related uterine pathology such as submucous myomata, endometrial hyperplasia, and polyps were more prominent, while in younger patients other uterine lesions such as adhesions and tubal ostia occlusion were more common.
 Moreover, treatment prior to IVF-ET resulted in 7 clinical pregnancies (8.9%) in group I and in 41 clinical pregnancies (19.9%) in group II, all of which failed in one to three cycles previously.
 It seems that hysteroscopic evaluation may reduce the IVF-ET failure rate due to intrauterine abnormalities in elderly as well as young patients, thus it becomes an absolute prerequisite for all patients scheduled for an IVF program.

 A temperature greater than 97.8 degrees F on the first 3 days of menses is associated with pelvic endometriosis.
 The findings of this study support the early clinical diagnosis of endometriosis in infertile women.

1514,"Genetic and familial predisposition to eclampsia and pre-eclampsia in a defined population.
 Familial predisposition and patterns of genetic inheritance of eclampsia and pre-eclampsia were investigated through three or four generations in 94 families from the homogenous island population of Iceland.
 The families descended from index women delivered in the years 1931-47 and who had either eclampsia (n = 38) or severe pre-eclampsia (n = 69).
 Inheritance was followed both through sons and daughters.
 The prevalence of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in daughters was significantly higher (23%) than that in daughters-in-law (10%).
 No difference was noted in the prevalence of these diseases by whether the daughter was born of an eclamptic or pre-eclamptic mother or whether she was a first or later born daughter.
 There was a non-significantly higher occurrence of pre-eclampsia among grand-daughters than in grand-daughters-in-law.
 No difference was seen by whether grand-daughters descended through sons or daughters.
 With increasing numbers of affected daughters or grand-daughters the probability rose of finding more affected women in a family.
 Hypotheses of single recessive and dominant gene inheritance were compared and maximum likelihood estimates for gene frequency obtained.
 For a single recessive gene model this was 0.31 reflecting a population prevalence of 9.6%, whereas a dominant model with incomplete penetrance gave 0.14 at 48% gene penetrance, corresponding to a population prevalence of 0.9% homozygous expression of severe disease and 11% heterozygous expression of milder disease.

2101,"Light scattering detection of microemboli in an extracorporeal LVAD bovine model.
 Thromboembolization studies were performed on two calves supported by extracorporeal left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) using a light scattering (He Ne Laser) microemboli detector (LSMD).
 The LSMD system was placed on the outflow cannula of the LVAD in the extracorporeal loop of each animal.
 The measurements included the size, number, and rate of production of circulating microemboli in the range 20 microns less than microemboli diameter less than 1,000 microns.
 These data were compared to independently and concurrently obtained measurements of emboli shear rate (CPF), platelet count, red blood count (RBC), leukocyte count (WBC), plasma free hemoglobin, factors XIII, X, and V, and sorbitol dehydrogenase.
 Embolic number and volume were seen to be most dynamic in the very early phases of acute thromboembolization (0-40 minutes) with a peak embolic response within the first 30 minutes.
 The dynamics of reduced emboli volume, rather than number, may be implicated in the later stages of the thromboembolic passivation of these ventricles.
 The LSMD results generally showed an inverse correlation of microemboli volume rate with CPF measurements for each ventricle.
 LSMD, CPF, and leukocyte and platelet counts, showed a direct correlation with reduced counts for each additional ventricle for both calves.
 Factor XII was seen to have a more direct correlation in time with LSMD measurements for each ventricle than other parameters under investigation.
 This study represents the first time laser scattering and filtration methods have been applied simultaneously with hematologic assays in order to study the dynamics of device associated thrombogenesis.

1691,"Digitalis-like activity in human plasma: relation to blood pressure and sodium balance.
 PURPOSE: On the assumption that renal tubular cells are more important as the target cells for a natriuretic factor than blood cells, we used a well-characterized cultured renal tubular cell line, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), cells to monitor the circulating digitalis-like factor in human plasma and examine its role in the regulation of blood pressure and sodium balance.
 SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We investigated the effects of plasma on binding of radioactive ouabain to monolayered MDCK cells in order to determine the level of a circulating digitalis-like factor.
 First, we measured specific 3H-ouabain binding to MDCK cells in the presence of plasma from 71 outpatients (34 normotensive subjects and 37 hypertensive patients) after incubation for 4 hours.
 Second, we measured specific 3H-ouabain binding after incubation of cells with plasma from 16 hospitalized subjects (eight normotensive subjects and eight hypertensive patients) receiving low and high sodium diets.
 RESULTS: In Study 1, ouabain binding was lower by 30% with plasma from hypertensive patients than with plasma from normotensive subjects (p less than 0.01).
 There was a significant negative correlation between individual subject's systolic or mean blood pressure and ouabain binding (r = -0.34, p less than 0.01 or r = -0.29, p less than 0.01).
 In Study 2, ouabain binding was also significantly reduced by 25% in the presence of plasma from hypertensive subjects as compared with plasma from normotensive subjects irrespective of sodium intake (p less than 0.01).
 A significant negative correlation was also found for all subjects between either systolic, diastolic, or mean blood pressure and ouabain binding (r = -0.58, p less than 0.01, r = -0.51, p less than 0.01, or r = -0.55, p less than 0.01, respectively).
 With the changes from low to high sodium intake, there was a corresponding decrease in ouabain binding (p less than 0.01) and an increase in sodium excretion (p less than 0.01).
 A significant negative correlation was observed between these two parameters (r = -0.47, p less than 0.05).
 CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a circulating digitalis-like factor, which may act on renal tubular cells as the ouabain-displacing compound, is increased in patients with essential hypertension and also demonstrate that plasma levels may be influenced by changes in dietary sodium intake.

2108,"Increase of intraplatelet free calcium ion during extracorporeal circulation with a hollow fiber oxygenator: arterial filter and dynamics of platelet thrombosis on oxygenator and filter in a pig model.
 Intraplatelet free calcium (IPFC) ions provide a common pathway for platelet activation leading to thrombosis and embolization.
 IPFC levels were determined by chlorotetracycline fluorometry during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) with systemic heparin in eight Yorkshire pigs (weighing 30-40 kg; 3 control and 5 ECC); the ratio of slow phase organelle calcium sequestration to fast phase platelet-membrane binding is an index of free calcium.
 During 3 hr of ECC with a hollow fiber oxygenator (HFO) (Bentley CM-50) and AF (Bentley 1025), seven blood samples were collected 5 min before and during ECC.
 The platelet deposition (CPM/microCi) on HFO (PDHFO) was simultaneously measured with In-111-labeled autologous platelets (300-400 microCi) and a Geiger probe detector at -5, 0, 5, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 180 min.
 During ECC, IPFC and HFO thrombus increase significantly (p less than 0.05) at 45 min with respect to control IPFC values of 0.4 +/- 0.1, suggesting direct participation of calcium activated platelets in thrombosis on HFO.
 The decline of IPFC is due to extrusion and sequestration by dense granules, and decline in HFO thrombus is due to embolization.
 On the other hand, the embolus in the arterial filter was trapped in a linear fashion, with a consistent increase with time of ECC.

 Using a telephone survey, patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (n = 31) and vascular dementia (n = 14) were compared with elderly normal controls (n = 43) in preferences for different foods.
 Patients with Alzheimer's disease had a greater preference than normal controls for relatively high-fat, sweet foods and for high-sugar, low-fat foods, but did not significantly differ in preference for other foods, including those high in complex carbohydrates and protein.
 Vascular dementia patients showed a similar pattern, not significantly different from that for Alzheimer's patients.
 Results did not consistently support a hypothesis that increased sweet preference is a nonspecific form of disinhibited behavior related to declining mental status, nor was a hypothesis relating sweet preference to serotonin activity within the brain consistently supported.
 Results provide preliminary evidence that craving for sweet food may be a significant part of the clinical syndrome of dementia, but further research is needed to delineate the psychological and biological mechanisms accounting for it.

 This study analyzes data from New York State's new Cardiac Surgery Reporting System, which contains information about cardiac preoperative risk factors, postoperative complications, and hospital discharge.
 The purposes of the study were to determine the set of significant clinical risk factors and to identify cardiac surgical centers most likely to have serious quality-of-care problems.
 Significant risk factors for in-hospital death were age, gender, ejection fraction, previous myocardial infarction, number of open heart operations in previous admissions, diabetes requiring medication, dialysis dependence, disasters (acute structural defect, renal failure, cardiogenic shock, gunshot), unstable angina, intractable congestive heart failure, left main trunk narrowed more than 90%, and type of operation performed.
 Four of the 28 hospitals had significantly higher mortality rates than expected, given the risk factors of their patients.
 Subsequent site visits and medical record reviews confirmed that these facilities had high percentages of quality-of-care problems among cases resulting in mortality.

1652,"Early postoperative balloon coronary angioplasty for failed coronary artery bypass grafting.
 In a small number of patients, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) fails to relieve anginal symptoms.
 The usefulness of coronary angioplasty for the treatment of early (less than or equal to 90 days) recurrent ischemia after CABG was examined.
 Forty-five patients were treated from 2 to 90 days after CABG, including 8 patients studied emergently for prolonged ischemic symptoms.
 One-, 2- and 3-vessel native disease was found in 4, 10 and 31 patients, respectively.
 At the time of postoperative angiography, the major anatomic mechanism of recurrent ischemia was complete vein graft occlusion in 12 patients (27%), internal mammary artery occlusion in 3 (7%), vein graft stenoses in 13 (29%), internal mammary artery stenoses in 10 (22%), unbypassed disease in 4 (8%) and disease distal to the graft insertion site in 3 (7%).
 Angioplasty was successful at 91 of 98 sites (93%), including 95% of 41 lesions in native arteries, 89% of 46 lesions in vein grafts and 100% of 11 internal mammary artery lesions attempted.
 Complete revascularization was achieved in 84% of patients.
 There were 2 in-hospital deaths and 2 myocardial infarctions.
 Two additional patients underwent repeat CABG before discharge after uncomplicated but unsuccessful angioplasty.
 At late follow-up of the 43 survivors (mean 44 months), there were 4 deaths, 2 of which were noncardiac.
 Repeat CABG was required in only 3 patients and repeat angioplasty was performed in 10.
 Angina was absent or minimal in 35 patients; 17 patients were employed full time.
 Thus, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty can relieve myocardial ischemia after unsuccessful CABG in the majority of patients.

 Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested that dietary calcium deficiency may lead to the development of hypertension.
 This article reviews findings in human trials on calcium intervention with special reference to the responses of blood pressure and biochemical variables.
 Calcium supplementation consistently resulted in decreased blood pressure in a subset of hypertensive and normotensive subjects, but led to increased blood pressure in some hypertensive patients.
 The variable blood pressure responses to calcium supplementation could not be predicted on the basis of routine biochemical parameters and appeared to be due to differences in the backgrounds of the subjects and/or the design and size of the trials.
 It is concluded that further studies are required on the hypotensive effect of calcium supplementation.

1982,"Pathogenesis of hyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension. Evidence of disordered venous innervation exclusively in the lower limbs.
 The pathogenesis of hyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension was studied in eight patients.
 Correction of the abnormal orthostatic changes by an inflated pressure suit (MAST) confirmed previous evidence of excessive gravitational pooling of blood in the leg veins.
 Intravenous L-norepinephrine infusion raised diastolic blood pressure in the same relationship to the infusion-induced increments in plasma norepinephrine concentrations as in normal subjects, indicating normal arteriolar responses.
 Contractile responses of the veins to infused L-norepinephrine were measured with a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT).
 The venous responses of hand veins in the patients fell within the 95% confidence limits of the responses of normal hand veins, as did the responses of foot veins in the seven normal subjects.
 However, foot veins of the patients with hyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension, and both hand and foot veins of patients with ""diffuse"" autonomic failure, were supersensitive to norepinephrine, as reflected by a steeper slope of the regression of log (norepinephrine infusion rate) on percentage reduction in venous distensibility, and a significantly lower ED50 (i.e., norepinephrine infusion rate that induced 50% reduction in venous distensibility).
 The findings suggest anatomical or functional postganglionic denervation of lower limb veins causing excessive gravitational blood pooling with consequent orthostatic hypotension in these patients.

1949,"Effect of intravenous streptokinase on early mortality in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction. A meta-analysis by anatomic location of infarction  [published erratum appears in Ann Intern Med 1991 Mar 15;114(6):522] 
 PURPOSE: To determine the effect of intravenous streptokinase on early mortality in patients with suspected acute anterior and acute inferior myocardial infarctions.
 DATA IDENTIFICATION: A literature search of English-language studies on the use of intravenous streptokinase in the treatment of suspected acute myocardial infarction for the period 1966 to 1989 using Medlars II and the bibliographies of relevant articles.
 In a number of instances, additional details on early mortality by location of myocardial infarction were provided by the authors.
 STUDY SELECTION: Of 140 originally identified articles, 6 that specifically met our inclusion criteria were selected: randomized trials that used intravenous streptokinase in a dose of 1.5 million units, with or without additional agents, compared with a group that differed only by the absence of streptokinase.
 Trials were selected by review of the methods section without regard for the results.
 DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted independently by two observers using specific methodologic criteria for infarct location and early mortality.
 After they conferred, the observers agreed completely on the data.
 RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Among the 9155 patients with suspected acute anterior myocardial infarction, the mortality rate in the control group was 17.4%.
 In contrast, patients treated with streptokinase had a 12.5% mortality.
 The mean risk difference was -4.8% (95% CI, -7.5% to -2.1%) and the summary risk ratio was 0.72 (CI, 0.65 to 0.79).
 A total of 9650 patients with suspected inferior infarction had a mortality rate in the control group of 7.6% [corrected].
 The mortality for streptokinase-treated patients was 6.6%.
 The mean risk difference was -0.8% (CI, -1.8% to 0.2%) and the summary risk ratio was 0.87 (CI, 0.76 to 1.01).
 CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous streptokinase clearly confers a protective effect against early mortality in patients with suspected acute anterior myocardial infarction.
 The magnitude of this effect is on the order of a 5% absolute reduction in risk of death by 21 to 35 days.
 For these patients, 21 need to be treated to save 1 additional life.
 For patients with suspected acute inferior infarction, the benefit of treatment on reducing early mortality is of smaller magnitude and less certain.
 These patients have an estimated absolute reduction of early mortality of approximately 1%, which would require treating 125 patients to save 1 additional life.

1645,"Neuroendocrine activity in congestive heart failure.
 The increased neuroendocrine activity in patients with congestive heart failure appears to be a generalized attempt to maintain blood pressure at the expense of reduced cardiac performance and salt and water retention.
 It is likely that baroreceptor dysfunction contributes to increased sympathetic nervous system activity in patients with congestive heart failure.
 The usual tonic inhibitory messages emanating from baro- and mechanoreceptors in the great vessels and heart fail to adjust sympathetic traffic from the brain to the periphery, leading to uninhibited sympathetic tone.
 Arginine vasopressin and plasma renin activity may be increased secondarily; however, plasma renin activity activation could also be induced by a low-salt diet and diuretic use.
 Preliminary baseline data indicate that patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%) but no or very mild symptoms of heart failure have increased plasma levels of norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic factor and arginine vasopressin, while plasma renin activity is normal, suggesting that neuroendocrine activity contributes to the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure.
 Neurohormones such as angiotensin II may alter gene expression, leading to changes in the shape and size of the cell.
 Remodeling of the heart and blood vessels is associated with both heart failure and hypertension.
 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been demonstrated to retard or reverse the remodeling process under certain experimental conditions.
 Studies are currently under way to test this possibility in patients.

2034,"A comparison of coarctation resection and subclavian flap angioplasty using ultrasonographically monitored postocclusive reactive hyperemia 
 The reported relatively high incidence of early restenosis at the coarctation repair site with subclavian flap angioplasty, especially in infants less than 3 months of age, prompted a physiologically oriented analysis of relief of obstruction from coarctation after subclavian flap angioplasty versus resection and end-to-end anastomosis in infancy.
 Twenty-one patients who had undergone repair of coarctation in infancy by either subclavian flap angioplasty (nine patients) (median age 8 years) or resection and end-to-end anastomosis (12 patients) (median age 8 years) were evaluated by Doppler spectrum analysis of the blood flow velocities in the femoral artery at rest and during reactive hyperemia.
 The median resting right upper to lower limb systolic pressure difference (with interquartile range) was similar in the angioplasty, resection and anastomosis, and control groups: -5 mm Hg (18 mm Hg), 0 mm Hg (12 mm Hg), and -2.5 mm Hg (10 mm Hg), respectively.
 Also, similar resting values for the maximum frequency of the advancing curve and the pulsatility and resistance indices were measured in the three groups.
 During reactive hyperemia of the leg, however, a significant hemodynamic obstruction across the repair site became clinically manifest in the angioplasty group only, as documented by a lower pulsatility index in comparison with the control group (p = 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test).
 Comparison of the hemodynamic results between the angioplasty and resection and anastomosis groups in subdivisions of infants operated on at an age of less or greater than 3 months, both at rest and during reactive hyperemia, showed, already at rest, a significantly lower value for the pulsatility index in the former angioplasty subdivision (p = 0.05, Student's t test), indicating a significant resistance at the coarctation repair site in the angioplasty patients operated on before the third month of life.
 A disadvantage of angioplasty (compared with resection and anastomosis) was noted when angioplasty was performed before the third month of life, and an unequivocal lack of advantage was noted when performed beyond that period regarding relief of obstruction from coarctation.
 In addition, a definite potential for adverse long-term effects on the hemodynamics of the left upper limb after subclavian flap angioplasty in infancy has been documented.
 For these reasons we prefer to perform resection and end-to-end anastomosis for repair of coarctation in infancy.

2103,"Hemodynamic influence of LVAD on right ventricular failure.
 Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) pumping has hemodynamic and anatomic influences on right ventricular performance.
 A total artificial heart (TAH) model was employed to better understand the hemodynamic influence of an LVAD on the failing right ventricle.
 Biventricular failure was simulated by reducing both ventricular drive pressures of the TAH.
 After getting hemodynamic data, LVAD pumping in the case of right ventricular failure was simulated by increasing just the left ventricular drive pressure.
 In the LVAD-simulating condition, cardiac output increased and right atrial pressure decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) compared with the biventricular failure condition, whereas right ventricular function and minute work were the same in these two conditions.
 Even though changes were accompanied by adaptive increases in pulmonary resistance, substantially lower pulmonary artery and left atrial pressures resulted in the LVAD-simulating condition.
 From a hemodynamic perspective, these results indicate that an LVAD can increase right ventricular volume work by decreasing right ventricular pressure work, whereas right ventricular net pressure-volume work is unchanged and right ventricular failure is not worsened.

2061,"Effect of halothane and isoflurane on postischemic ""stunned"" myocardium in the dog.
 Short periods of coronary artery occlusion are known to produce prolonged periods of ventricular dysfunction.
 The effects of halothane or isoflurane on contractility and metabolism in postischemic ""stunned"" myocardium were studied in an open-chest canine model in which the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was occluded for 15 min and then reperfused.
 Regional function in the LAD and circumflex artery (CIRC) areas were measured with sonomicrometry, and metabolic data were determined from simultaneous arterial and venous measurements of oxygen and lactate.
 Halothane and isoflurane produced equivalent decreases in systolic shortening in both normal (CIRC) and stunned (LAD) areas of the heart.
 Furthermore, the amount of depression was similar with either halothane or isoflurane.
 Halothane 0.75 MAC significantly decreased systolic shortening in both the LAD region (from 38.8 +/- 25.9% to 11.0 +/- 21.8%) and in the CIRC region (from 116.7 +/- 24.7% to 87.5 +/- 23.3%).
 At equivalent MAC concentrations of isoflurane, the values were 42.5 +/- 45.7 to -7.0 +/- 49.9% in the LAD region and 91.5 +/- 11.9% to 66.9 +/- 23.9% in the CIRC area.
 At 1.5-MAC halothane, systolic shortening in the LAD region decreased from 47.9 +/- 47.2% to -0.6 +/- 20.3% and in the CIRC area from 114.6 +/- 16.8% to 76.0 +/- 18.7%.
 Isoflurane at 1.5 MAC produced significant decreases, from 23.4 +/- 54.5% to -15.6 +/- 27.1% in the LAD region and from 94.4 +/- 33.2% to 61.3 +/- 28.2 in the CIRC area.

1587,"Primary repair for complete atrioventricular canal: recommendation for early primary repair.
 Forty patients with complete atrioventricular canal (CAVC) underwent primary repair at Fukuoka Children's Hospital in Fukuoka, Japan, between August 1, 1981 and July 31, 1989.
 The age at repair ranged from 2 months to 6 years (mean 19 months); weight ranged from 2.3 to 22 kg.
 The surgical mortality was 2.5%.
 Justification for early primary repair was examined.
 Eleven patients underwent repair before 6 months of age (Group 1), 12 patients, between 7 and 11 months of age (Group 2), and 17 patients, after 12 months of age (Group 3).
 Degenerative changes in the atrioventricular valve increased significantly as age at repair increased (p less than 0.05 Group 1 versus Group 3).
 The incidence of residual mitral regurgitation tended to increase in the order of Group 1, 2 and 3, though the degree ranged from trivial to mild.
 Study of the left atrium/aorta ratio by echocardiography revealed that stable values of around 1.1 in Groups 1 and 2 and around 1.3 in Group 3 continued during the follow-up period of 3 years.
 Assessment of the diameter of the repaired mitral valve in the mean interval of 26 months in groups 1 and 2 revealed normal growth of the mitral valve annulus.
 The angle between the repaired mitral valve and ventricular septum, which can be affected by the growth of the ventricular septum, converged to normal range in the mean interval of 26 months.
 Postoperative pulmonary vascular resistance in Groups 2 and 3 was higher at 4.4 +/- 2.3 and 6.3 +/- 2.2, respectively, than in Group 1 at 3.3 +/- 2.2 (p less than 0.01 versus Group 3).

1919,"Predictive value of lipoprotein (a) and other serum lipoproteins in the angiographic diagnosis of coronary artery disease.
 To determine the relation among lipids in predicting coronary artery disease (CAD), 213 patients undergoing diagnostic angiography for suspected CAD were prospectively studied.
 Twenty-one patients had normal coronary arteries and 192 had CAD in 1 to 3 arteries at arteriography with measurements obtained with digital calipers.
 Lipoproteins were measured and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] was also assayed in a subset of 98 patients with CAD.
 Statistical analysis was performed using uni- and multivariate techniques to test the association among age, gender, systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, family history, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoproteins (apo) A-I and apo B, ratio of apo A-I to apo B, and ratio of HDL cholesterol to total cholesterol, to Lp(a) and to CAD.
 All factors except gender, systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cigarette smoking were univariate predictors of CAD.
 Multivariate predictors were, in decreasing order of significance, family history, age, HDL/total cholesterol ratio and apo B.
 When Lp(a) was included, multivariate predictors were age, family history, apo B and Lp(a), in that order.
 Lipid parameters alone showed that the HDL/total cholesterol ratio and that Lp(a) provide the best predictive tests for the detection of CAD in this referral population and may ultimately become important screening tests for CAD.

1666,"Percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty.
 To determine the efficacy of percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty as an adjunct or alternative to conventional balloon angioplasty, 55 patients were studied in a multicenter trial.
 These patients underwent the procedure using a modification of conventional balloon angioplasty technique.
 A first-generation, 1.6-mm diameter catheter constructed of 12 individual silica fibers concentrically arranged around a guidewire lumen was used.
 Catheter tip energy density varied from 35 to 50 mJ/mm2.
 The mean number of pulses delivered at 20 Hz was 1,272 +/- 1,345.
 Acute success was defined as a greater than or equal to 20% increase in stenotic diameter and a lumen of greater than or equal to 1 mm in diameter after laser treatment.
 Acute success was achieved in 46 of 55 (84%) patients.
 Adjunctive balloon angioplasty was performed on 41 patients (75%).
 The percent diameter stenosis as determined by quantitative angiography decreased from a baseline of 83 +/- 14 to 49 +/- 11% after laser treatment and to 38 +/- 12% in patients undergoing adjunctive balloon angioplasty.
 The mean minimal stenotic diameter increased from a baseline of 0.5 +/- 0.4 to 1.6 +/- 0.5 mm after laser treatment and to 2.1 +/- 0.5 mm after balloon angioplasty.
 There were no deaths and no vascular perforations.
 One patient (1.8%) required emergency coronary bypass surgery.
 These data suggest that excimer laser energy delivered percutaneously by specially constructed catheters can safely ablate atheroma and reduce coronary stenoses.

2085,"Stunned myocardium during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
 The ""stunned myocardium"" is a syndrome of reversible myocardial dysfunction that may be mediated by oxygen-derived free radicals.
 This phenomenon has been seen in some neonates undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
 We performed echocardiograms and measured creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes and lipid peroxide levels in 16 neonates before, during, and after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
 Infants who developed stunned myocardia by echocardiography did so shortly after initiation of bypass and exhibited concurrent elevations of the MB fraction of creatine phosphokinase.
 Lipid peroxide levels did not simultaneously rise.
 These data suggest that oxygen-derived free radicals may not cause the stunned myocardium seen in neonates undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

1849,"Termination of acute atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome by procainamide and propafenone: importance of atrial fibrillatory cycle length.
 The effects of intravenous procainamide (n = 30) or propafenone (n = 25) were evaluated in 55 patients with acute atrial fibrillation and the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
 All patients received either procainamide (12 to 15 mg/kg body weight) or propafenone (1 to 2 mg/kg) during sustained (greater than 10 min) atrial fibrillation or after termination of nonsustained atrial fibrillation.
 Termination of atrial fibrillation was attributed to a drug if it occurred less than or equal to 15 min after infusion.
 Measurements included mean cycle length of fibrillatory electrograms (mean AA interval) as measured at the high right atrium and shortest RR interval between pre-excited cycles during atrial fibrillation.
 Atrial fibrillation terminated more frequently after procainamide administration (65%) than after propafenone (46%), although this difference was not significant.
 Procainamide prolonged the shortest pre-excited RR interval (228 +/- 41 to 339 +/- 23 ms, p = 0.0001) as did propafenone (215 +/- 40 to 415 +/- 198 ms, p = 0.0001) and the magnitude of increase was greater for propafenone (p = 0.048).
 Patients with sustained atrial fibrillation had shorter mean AA intervals than did their counterparts with nonsustained atrial fibrillation (123 +/- 25 versus 186 +/- 35 ms, p = 0.0001).
 Termination of sustained atrial fibrillation by either drug was accompanied by prolongation of the mean AA interval but not necessarily by the shortest pre-excited RR interval.
 Termination of atrial fibrillation was heralded by a 68% increase in the mean AA interval after procainamide administration compared with a 30% increase when the arrhythmia persisted.
 For propafenone the increases were 90% and 68%, respectively.

2060,"Incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia detected by different electrocardiographic systems 
 To determine the extent to which different electrocardiographic systems account for differences in reported incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia, the authors simultaneously recorded in 109 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) the V5 or modified CM5 lead on five ECG systems by means of a specially constructed common V5 lead.
 The systems included a Spacelabs Alpha 14 Model Series 3200 ECG Cardule at bandwidths of 0.05-125 Hz and 0.5-30 Hz (a typical operating room monitor), a Marquette Electronics MAC II ECG at 0.05-40 Hz and 0.05-100 Hz (a standard ECG), and a Del Mar Holter recorder at 0.1-100 Hz.
 Relative ST-segment position and incidence of new ischemia compared to the preoperative ECG were determined in 109 sets of preinduction traces and 877 sets of intraoperative traces.
 ST-segment position on the three recording systems conforming with the American Heart Association (AHA) low-frequency response recommendations (0.05 Hz) were similar.
 Compared to the standard ECG, ST-segment position on the Spacelabs at 0.5-30 Hz was consistently more negative.
 Displacement on the Holter was consistently less negative and less positive.
 By the 0.1-mV displacement criterion for diagnosis of myocardial ischemia on any one ECG system, 16.5% of patients on arrival and 32.1% of patients intraoperatively suffered new myocardial ischemia.
 Based on the operating room monitor, arrival and intraoperative ischemia were present in 15.6 and 27.5% of patients, respectively.
 Ischemia at the same periods was less frequent by the standard ECG system (5.5 and 12.8%, respectively) and least frequent by the Holter recorder (4.6 and 8.3%, respectively).

1929,"Effects of calcium channel blockade on calcium homeostasis in mild to moderate essential hypertension.
 Calcium channel blockers may alter parathyroid hormone secretion in vitro, which would alter calcium homeostasis.
 To determine the chronic effect of calcium channel blockade in vivo, we conducted a randomized, double blind, 16 week study comparing the effects of two pharmacologic antihypertensive agents, the calcium channel blocker diltiazem and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on parameters of calcium homeostasis.
 Both diltiazem and captopril lowered blood pressure to a similar degree.
 Neither drug produced any significant change in blood levels of total and ionized calcium, magnesium, or phosphorus, which affect the regulation of parathyroid hormone and vitamin D.
 In addition, at eight or 16 weeks following initiation, neither drug altered the serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D3 (1,25-D).
 Chronic calcium channel blockade with diltiazem does not alter serum parameters of calcium homeostasis and, thus, should not affect bone mineralization.

2023,"Brief angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment in young spontaneously hypertensive rats reduces blood pressure long-term 
 Our study examines the long-term cardiovascular effects after a brief period of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).
 SHR were treated with perindopril (3 mg/kg/day) by gavage from 2 to 6, from 6 to 10, or from 2 to 10 weeks of age.
 Systolic blood pressure was measured in the tail weekly until 25 weeks of age.
 Corresponding control groups received distilled water for the same periods.
 In each treatment group blood pressure was reduced significantly during treatment, rose when treatment stopped, but plateaued significantly below control SHR thereafter.
 This difference in blood pressure at 25 weeks of age was due to reduced total peripheral resistance as determined by microsphere methods, but plasma renin activity and angiotensin II concentrations were not different.
 Cardiac hypertrophy was also reduced in treated SHR.
 In a separate experiment, perindopril treatment from 6 to 10 weeks of age resulted in a significant reduction in the media/lumen ratios of mesenteric resistance vessels at 32 weeks of age.
 Concomitant administration of angiotensin II with perindopril from 6 to 10 weeks of age not only prevented the long-term effects on blood pressure seen with perindopril treatment alone but was associated with cardiovascular hypertrophy in excess of untreated control SHR.
 Finally, perindopril given for a shorter period (6 to 7 weeks) or later in life (20 to 24 weeks) had no significant long-term effects on blood pressure.
 These results demonstrate that a 4-week period of ACE inhibitor treatment in young SHR is sufficient to prevent the full expression of genetic hypertension and cardiovascular hypertrophy and that angiotensin II might be important in the development of hypertension in this model, its role in later life being less important.

1548,"Prevalence of aortic regurgitation by color flow Doppler in relation to aortic root size.
 To determine whether there is a correlation between aortic root size and the prevalence of aortic regurgitation, we performed color flow Doppler echocardiographic studies on 1015 consecutive patients during a 3-month period.
 Patients were grouped according to their M-mode aortic root diameter as measured in the left parasternal position.
 The measured groups ranged from 2.0 to 4.5 cm, grouped at 0.1 cm intervals.
 As the aortic root size enlarged, the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increased linearly (p less than 0.001; correlation coefficient, r = 0.75).
 At an aortic root size in the ""small normal"" range of 2.0 to 2.4 cm, the prevalence of aortic regurgitation was 0% to 15%.
 In the ""intermediate"" and ""top normal"" ranges of 2.9 to 3.7 cm, the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increased linearly from 15% to 47%.
 With aortic root dilation, the prevalence of aortic root regurgitation was generally more than 50%.
 The severity of aortic regurgitation was semiquantified.
 Aortic root size was not a good indicator for the severity of aortic regurgitation.
 Patients with moderate and severe aortic regurgitation had variable aortic root sizes.
 Throughout the range of aortic root sizes, mild aortic regurgitation predominated.
 We conclude that aortic regurgitation is a common finding in patients with aortic roots that are dilated or are in the ""top normal"" size range, that the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increases linearly with aortic root size, and that aortic root size does not correlate with the severity of aortic regurgitation.

 Three times daily administration of isosorbide dinitrate may avoid much of the tolerance seen with more frequent dosing.
 To determine the daylong pattern of the antianginal effect of three times daily isosorbide dinitrate, eight men with stable exertional angina and a positive exercise test were studied.
 The subjects had demonstrated increased exercise duration in response to oral isosorbide dinitrate therapy and absence of complete tolerance to long-term three times daily isosorbide dinitrate.
 Treadmill exercise to onset of angina was performed over 2 days at 8 AM, 9 AM, 11 AM, 1 PM, 2 PM, 4 PM, 6 PM and 7 PM.
 On one day each patient received isosorbide dinitrate at 8 AM, 1 PM and 6 PM in a previously titrated dose (mean 27.5 mg), which had been taken three times daily for at least 2 weeks.
 On the other day at the same hours each patient received double blind a placebo identical in appearance to isosorbide dinitrate.
 One hour after the 8 AM dose of isosorbide dinitrate, mean systolic blood pressure at rest had fallen by 19 mm Hg and mean exercise time to angina increased by 200 s.
 However, by 11 AM exercise time had returned to control level.

 Calcium channel blockers have been effective as pulmonary vasodilators in patients with pulmonary hypertension.
 The current study therefore compared the effects of prostaglandin E1, an effective pulmonary vasodilator, with the effects of the water-soluble calcium channel blocker diltiazem during pulmonary hypertension in sheep.
 Pulmonary hypertension was produced by continuous intravenous administration of U46619 to halothane-anesthetized sheep.
 Prostaglandin E1 decreased pulmonary artery pressure 29%, decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (Rp) 57%, and did not affect the ratio of pulmonary to systemic vascular resistance (Rp/Rs).
 Diltiazem decreased pulmonary artery pressure 15%, decreased Rp 50%, and did not affect Rp/Rs.
 When 0.33 mL/kg polyethylene glycol-ethanol vehicle (the vehicle used for nifedipine administration in a prior study) was administered during diltiazem infusion, pulmonary artery pressure increased 19%, Rp increased 72%, and Rp/Rs increased 29%.
 These results indicate that diltiazem is an effective pulmonary vasodilator and suggest that the previously reported unfavorable results of nifedipine may have been due to the vehicle used for nifedipine administration.

 One hundred two patients undergoing abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery were prospectively, randomly allocated to two groups, one of which was monitored with a central venous catheter and the other with a pulmonary artery catheter.
 Patients with uncompensated cardiopulmonary or renal disease were excluded from the study.
 General anesthesia was administered for the surgical procedure, and the patients were followed through hospital discharge.
 No statistically significant differences occurred between the two groups with regard to morbidity (perioperative cardiac, pulmonary or renal sequelae), mortality rate, duration of intensive care, postoperative hospital stay, or cost of hospitalization.
 The one statistically significant difference between groups was the professional fee charged for anesthetic care, which was higher for patients with pulmonary artery catheters than for those with central venous catheters.
 In conclusion, we prospectively gathered data from most patients presented for abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery.
 Our data seem to indicate that the choice of central venous catheter or pulmonary artery catheter monitoring makes little difference in outcome after abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery, and that for many patients pulmonary artery catheters are not necessary to give appropriate, adequate care.
 Because of the size of the sample, however, declarations of epidemiologic significance would be unfounded.

 Nebivolol is a novel B-1-adrenoceptor-blocking drug with an unusual hemodynamic profile unlike classical B-blockers.
 In dogs and in healthy volunteers it decreases blood pressure and heart rate but improves left ventricular function.
 The authors studied 10 male patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure (ejection fraction mean = 46%).
 A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed into the pulmonary artery, and the mean blood pressure, the heart rate, the pulmonary artery pressure, the pulmonary wedge pressure, the right atrial pressure, the cardiac output, and the stroke volume were measured at rest and on exertion before and after seven days' treatment with oral nebivolol (5 mg/day).
 While the blood pressure and the heart rate decreased significantly, the pulmonary artery and wedge pressures, as well as the right atrial pressure and the cardiac output, did not change during treatment.
 The stroke volume increased significantly.
 The maintained cardiac output cannot be explained by any changes in preload or afterload; instead a positive inotropic mechanism must be assumed.
 Unlike other B-blockers it seems to be possible to treat patients with heart failure with nebivolol without causing the hemodynamic situation to deteriorate.

 Intracoronary urokinase was used to treat flow-limiting intracoronary thrombus accumulation that complicated successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) during acute ischemic syndromes in 48 patients who were followed up through the acute phase of their illness.
 The study group comprised 10 patients with unstable angina pectoris, 18 patients with an evolving acute myocardial infarction, and 20 patients with postinfarction angina.
 The initial mean percent coronary diameter stenosis for the entire population was 95 +/- 7% and decreased with initial PTCA to 41 +/- 20% (p less than 0.001), with improved corresponding coronary flow by Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial (TIMI) grade.
 However, thrombus accumulation then resulted in a significant increase in percent diameter stenosis to 83 +/- 17% (p less than 0.001); a corresponding significant reduction in coronary flow also occurred by TIMI grade.
 After administration of intracoronary urokinase (mean dose, 141,000 units; range, 100,000-250,000 units during an average period of 34 minutes), with additional PTCA, mean percent diameter stenosis significantly decreased to 34 +/- 17% (p less than 0.001); a correspondingly significant improvement in mean coronary flow by TIMI grade occurred to 2.9 +/- 0.2.
 Overall, the angiographic success rate was 90%.

 Serum K+, blood pressure and heart rate were measured before (casual) and after (baseline) 20 min of rest in the recumbent position.
 Baseline serum K+ values were significantly higher than casual values in patients participating to the experimental protocol while no change was observed in inpatients undergoing routine blood sampling.
 The increase in serum K+ induced by relaxation was significantly related to heart rate decrease (r = 0.73).
 After relaxation 75% of patients had an increase in serum K+ with a change greater than 10% in about 35% of patients.
 In a subgroup of patients who repeated the same test three times, the alarm reaction was still evident and not reproducible within each patient.

1876,"Long-term outcome after surgical repair of isolated atrial septal defect. Follow-up at 27 to 32 years 
 BACKGROUND.
 Atrial septal defects have been surgically correctable for more than 30 years.
 The long-term survival rates among patients treated in the early era of cardiac surgery are poorly documented, but such data are of critical importance to the future medical care, employability, and insurability of these patients.
 METHODS.
 To determine the natural history of surgically corrected atrial septal defects, we studied all 123 patients who underwent repair of an isolated defect (ostium secundum or sinus venosus) at the Mayo Clinic between 1956 and 1960, 27 to 32 years after the procedure.
 The follow-up status of all patients was determined by written questionnaires and telephone interviews.
 Hospital records and death certificates were obtained if interim hospitalization or death had occurred.
 RESULTS.
 The overall 30-year actuarial survival rate among survivors of the perioperative period was 74 percent, as compared with 85 percent among controls matched for age and sex.
 The perioperative mortality was 3.3 percent (four deaths).
 Actuarial 27-year survival rates among patients in the younger two quartiles according to age at operation (less than or equal to 11 years and 12 to 24 years) were no different from rates among controls--97 percent and 93 percent, respectively.
 In the two older quartiles (25 to 41 years and greater than 41 years), 27-year survival rates were significantly less (P less than 0.001)--84 percent and 40 percent, respectively--than in controls (91 and 59 percent).
 Independent predictors of long-term survival according to multivariate analysis were age at operation (P less than 0.0001) and systolic pressure in the main pulmonary artery before operation (P less than 0.0027).
 When repair was performed in older patients, late cardiac failure, stroke, and atrial fibrillation were significantly more frequent.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Among patients with surgically repaired atrial septal defects, those operated on before the age of 25 have an excellent prognosis, but older patients require careful, regular supervision.

2001,"Impact of a public cholesterol screening program.
 The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has endorsed physician case finding as the primary method to detect individuals with elevated cholesterol levels.
 Despite this recommendation, promotional and for-profit public screening programs have flourished.
 We surveyed participants of a mall-based cholesterol screening program 1 year after their screening.
 Sixty-four percent of those screened had not previously known their cholesterol levels.
 Those who were newly screened were less likely to benefit from this testing than the general public, since they were older (mean age, 55.3 years), more likely to be female (67.4%), and nonsmokers (88%).
 Screenees had excellent recall of their cholesterol level (mean absolute reporting error, 0.24 mmol/L [9 mg/dL]) and a good understanding of cholesterol as a coronary heart disease risk.
 Those with elevated cholesterol levels reported high distress from screening but no reduction in overall psychosocial well-being and an actual decrease in absenteeism.
 Only 53.7% of all who were advised to seek follow-up because of an elevated screening value had done so within the year following the screening program.
 However, of those with values greater than 6.2 mmol/L (240 mg/dL), 68% had sought follow-up.
 Many of those who participate in public screening programs have been previously tested, fall into low-benefit groups, or fail to comply with recommended follow-up.
 We therefore conclude that cholesterol screening programs of the type now commonly offered are unlikely to contribute greatly to the national efforts to further reduce coronary heart disease.

 The selection of patients for either high-risk reparative operations on the heart or for transplantation has become increasingly difficult as a result of improved results with both modalities.
 A retrospective review was done of patients referred for heart transplantation who were not considered candidates for conventional cardiac surgery, yet instead underwent reparative procedures rather than transplantation.
 Of 23 adult patients referred during a 7-year period, 18 had coronary artery disease, and five had valvular heart disease.
 All had New York Heart Association class IV symptoms.
 Preoperative left ventricular ejection fractions were in the range 0.08-0.63 (mean, 0.28).
 Ten of 18 patients with coronary artery disease required insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump for hemodynamic support perioperatively.
 Seven patients had primary coronary artery bypass grafts, and 10 had reoperative coronary bypass procedures.
 One patient had a left ventricular aneurysmectomy, and one had endocardial stripping in addition to myocardial revascularization procedures.
 Of the patients with valvular disease, three had aortic valve replacement, of which two were reoperations, and two others had mitral valve replacements with tricuspid annuloplasties.

1914,"Effect of beta-adrenergic blocking agents on the circadian occurrence of ischemic cardiovascular events.
 Clinical observations suggest that beta-adrenergic blocking agents can modify the circadian occurrence of a variety of ischemic events.
 Morning awakening is associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure and pulse, serum catecholamine content and platelet activation, at a time of decreased blood thrombolytic activity.
 Beta-adrenergic blocking agents have the potential to modify many of these events.
 Current data indicate that these agents modify blood pressure and pulse, but do not prevent their early morning increase.
 In addition, beta-adrenergic blocking agents decrease ventricular ectopy and its circadian variation.
 Recent studies in humans indicate, however, that metoprolol does not affect the circadian increase in platelet activity or serum catecholamines.
 The specific mechanism by which beta blockers affect the circadian occurrence of ischemic events remains uncertain.

 CT scanning became available in this unit in 1983 and between 1983 and 1987 was used as the only imaging investigation in 32 patients with suspected acute dissection of the thoracic aorta while in a further 22 patients aortography was used alone.
 Results were confirmed at surgery (n = 18), necropsy (n = 3), or supported by clinical outcome (n = 31).
 Two patients were lost to follow up.
 In an additional 16 patients both aortography and CT scanning were performed with concordant findings in 10.
 In six in whom the results were discordant, aortography was normal in three in whom subsequent CT scanning showed type B dissection and CT scanning was normal in three patients in whom aortography showed type A dissection.
 Both CT scanning and aortography are reliable techniques for assessment of suspected acute dissection of the thoracic aorta.
 Both techniques misdiagnose occasionally and the frequency of misdiagnosis will be minimised by performing both investigations in patients where the level of clinical suspicion is high and the initial investigation negative.
 CT scanning tends to miss type A dissection and in view of the success of surgery in this condition this failing has the more serious clinical consequences.

1917,"Effects of theophylline, atenolol and their combination on myocardial ischemia in stable angina pectoris.
 The effects of theophylline (400 mg twice a day), atenolol (50 mg twice a day) and their combination on myocardial ischemia were studied in 9 patients with stable angina pectoris in a randomized, single-blind, triple crossover trial.
 Placebo was administered to the patients during the run-in and the run-off periods.
 A treadmill exercise test and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring were obtained at the end of each treatment period.
 Compared with placebo, theophylline significantly improved the time to onset of myocardial ischemia (1 mm of ST-segment depression) from 7.8 +/- 3.7 to 9.5 +/- 3.7 minutes (p less than 0.03) and the exercise duration from 9 +/- 3.4 to 10.1 +/- 3.5 minutes (p less than 0.04).
 During atenolol and during combination treatment, the time to the onset of ischemia and the exercise duration were similar (10.8 +/- 4.2 and 11.2 +/- 3.2 minutes, 11.2 +/- 3.6 and 11.5 +/- 3.2 minutes, respectively) and longer than during theophylline administration (p less than 0.05).
 Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring showed that, during theophylline administration, the heart rate was higher than during placebo throughout the 24 hours (p less than 0.05).
 During atenolol and during combination treatment the heart rate was similar and in both cases lower than during placebo (p less than 0.05).
 Compared with placebo, theophylline decreased the total ischemic time from 97 +/- 110 to 70 +/- 103 minutes (p less than 0.05).

2029,"Similar frequencies of renin gene restriction fragment length polymorphisms in hypertensive and normotensive subjects.
 A prospective study was conducted to compare the frequency of renin gene polymorphisms in normotensive and hypertensive subjects.
 Hypertensive (n = 102, blood pressure 168 +/- 17/103 +/- 9 mm Hg) and normotensive (n = 120, blood pressure 122 +/- 10/75 +/- 9 mm Hg) subjects were white, had similar age and sex distributions (hypertensive group, 45 +/- 10 years old and 52% female; normotensive group, 44 +/- 9 years old and 55% female) and similar body mass index (hypertensive group, 23.2 +/- 2.6; normotensive group, 22.5 +/- 2.4 kg/m2, p = 0.048).
 The familial susceptibility to hypertension was defined as at least one parent and one sibling who were hypertensive before age 65; subjects in the normotensive group had no familial history of hypertension.
 Renin gene polymorphisms located throughout the renin gene were identified by using three restriction enzymes (Taq I, HinfI, HindIII).
 For each polymorphic restriction site, allele frequencies were similar in the hypertensive and the normotensive groups.
 In the absence of parental genotypes, the haplotype frequencies combining the three restriction fragment length polymorphisms were estimated by using maximum likelihood techniques and were similar in both groups (hypertensive group, 0.429, 0.277, and 0.177; normotensive group, 0.453, 0.245, and 0.195 for the three most common haplotypes).
 A rare haplotype detected by Taq I/Hind III was apparently more frequent in the hypertensive than in the normotensive group (hypertensive group, tH 0.086, th 0.022; normotensive group, tH 0.038, th 0.050), but the difference was not statistically significant.
 In conclusion, no association between renin gene polymorphisms and essential hypertension was demonstrated in the present study.

2054,"Efficacy of ibopamine in the treatment of heart failure.
 Loss of myocardial contractility, reflexly enhanced vasoconstriction, and neuroendocrine excitation are the pathophysiologic hallmarks of low-output heart failure.
 Drugs that counter both consequences afford considerable therapeutic potential in retarding and perhaps even in staying the consequences of the syndrome.
 Ibopamine possesses such potential through its unique ability to stimulate both dopaminergic- and beta-adrenoreceptors in the heart and circulatory system.
 Stimulation of dopaminergic- receptors and beta 2-adrenoreceptors results in vasodilatation in all regional vascular territories.
 beta 2-Adrenoreceptor agonist activity also affords mild positive inotropic activity in the heart, whereas stimulation of presynaptic dopaminergic- receptors (DA2) attenuates the increased sympathetic neural outflow.
 The drug also suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in addition to having a direct natriuretic activity.
 The pharmacodynamic effects of ibopamine, exerted through its metabolite epinine, are translated into measurable therapeutic benefits in patients with chronic heart failure.
 The increase in peripheral blood flow induced in all regional vascular territories, including the kidneys, is associated with increased cardiac output and stroke volume and reduction in left ventricular pressure work, wall stress, and myocardial oxygen consumption.
 Plasma norepinephrine, angiotensin, and aldosterone are also reduced, and renal sodium excretion is enhanced.
 These hemodynamic and neuroendocrine activities, which are not subject to tolerance during sustained administration of the drug, are accompanied by clinically significant improvement in symptoms, exercise tolerance, and the New York Heart Association classification of disability.
 More important, no proarrhythmic effects have been observed during sustained treatment, and the minimal side effects observed during long-term treatment enhance the safety profile of the drug.

1654,"Usefulness of verapamil for congestive heart failure associated with abnormal left ventricular diastolic filling and normal left ventricular systolic performance.
 Normal left ventricular systolic performance with impaired left ventricular diastolic filling may be present in a substantial number of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).
 To evaluate the effect of oral verapamil in this subset, 20 men (mean age 68 +/- 5 years) with CHF, intact left ventricular function (ejection fraction greater than 45%) and abnormal diastolic filling (peak filling rate less than 2.5 end-diastolic volumes per second [edv/s]) were studied in a placebo-controlled, double-blind 5-week crossover trial.
 All patients underwent echocardiography to rule out significant valvular disease, and thallium-201 stress scintigraphy to exclude major active ischemia.
 Compared to baseline values, verapamil significantly improved exercise capacity by 33% (13.9 +/- 4.3 vs 10.7 +/- 3.4 minutes at baseline) and peak filling rate by 30% (2.29 +/- 0.54 vs 1.85 +/- 0.45 edv/s at baseline) (all p less than 0.05).
 Placebo values were 12.3 +/- 4.0 minutes and 2.16 +/- 0.48 edv/s, respectively (difference not significant for both).
 Improvement from baseline in an objective clinico-radiographic heart failure score (scale 0 to 13) was significantly greater with verapamil compared to placebo (median improvement in score: 3 vs 1, p less than 0.01).
 Mean ejection fraction and systolic blood pressure were unchanged from baseline; diastolic blood pressure and heart rate decreased to a small degree.
 Verapamil may have therapeutic efficacy in patients with CHF, preserved systolic function and impaired diastolic filling.

2080,"Physiologic peripheral pulmonic stenosis in infancy.
 We studied 14 premature infants with the clinical diagnosis of peripheral pulmonic stenosis (PPS) and 15 normal full-term neonates by echocardiographic Doppler examinations.
 The PPS group had an average main pulmonary artery (PA) diameter similar to the control group (0.91 vs 0.96 cm, difference not significant), but had smaller branch PA diameters: right PA = 0.41 vs 0.50 cm, p less than 0.001, and left PA = 0.41 vs 0.49 cm, p less than 0.001.
 The PPS group also had greater peak velocities in the main PA (76 vs 63 cm/s, p less than 0.05), right PA (193 vs 118 cm/s, p less than 0.001) and left PA (187 vs 123 cm/s, p less than 0.001).
 Similarly, the ratio of peak velocity in the branch/main PA was greater for the PPS group: right/main PA peak velocity = 2.91 vs 1.92, p less than 0.01, and left/main PA peak velocity = 2.73 vs 1.99, p less than 0.05.
 The calculated right ventricular output for the PPS group was more than the control group: 437 vs 261 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.001.
 Hematocrits were not done on the control group, but the PPS group had an average hematocrit which was low (34%).
 It is concluded that patients with PPS have mild underdevelopment of the PA branches, with consequent increased flow velocity and turbulent flow.
 This turbulent flow may be contributed to by increased cardiac output and mild anemia.

1790,"The changing clinical spectrum of thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease).
 Between 1970 and 1987, 112 patients were diagnosed as having thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO).
 The age was 42 +/- 11 years (mean +/- SD; range, 20-75 years); 23% were women, and 7% were more than 60 years old when they were first diagnosed.
 Ischemic ulcerations were present in 85 (76%) patients: 24 (28%) patients with upper-extremity, 39 (46%) patients with lower-extremity, and 22 (26%) patients with both upper- and lower-extremity lesions.
 Ninety-one (81%) patients had rest pain, 49 (44%) patients had Raynaud's phenomenon, and 43 (38%) patients had superficial thrombophlebitis.
 We were able to follow up 89 of the 112 (79%) patients for 1-460 months (mean follow-up time, 91.6 +/- 84 months).
 Sixty-five (73%) patients had no amputations, while 24 (27%) had one or more of the following amputations: finger, six (15%) patients; toe, 13 (33%) patients; transmetatarsal, four (10%) patients; below knee, 14 (36%) patients; and above knee, two (5%) patients.
 Forty-three (48%) patients stopped smoking for a mean of 80 +/- 105 months (median, 46.5 months; range, 1-420 months), and only two (5%) patients had amputations after they stopped smoking, while 22 (42%) patients had amputations while continuing to smoke (p less than 0.0001).
 The spectrum of patients with TAO is changing in that the male-to-female ratio is decreasing (3:1), more older patients are being diagnosed, and upper-extremity involvement is commonly present.
 In the 48% of patients who stopped smoking, amputations and continued disease activity were uncommon.

 Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using thallium-201 (Tl-201) was compared with technetium-99m hexakis 2-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (Tc-99m MIBI) in 24 patients with coronary artery diseaes.
 Patients exercised to the same work load as each isotope was studied.
 Normal and hypoperfused left ventricular mass was determined with an automated method.
 Estimated total left ventricular mass was similar for both stress/redistribution Tl-201 and stress/rest Tc-99m MIBI images.
 The mean estimated defect size in the redistribution Tl-201 images was 32 +/- 34.7 vs 33 +/- 38.4 g in the resting Tc-99m MIBI studies (difference not significant).
 The individual determinations of defect mass were highly correlated (r = 0.93; p less than 0.0001).
 Estimated defect size in the stress Tl-201 images (52 +/- 46.2 g) was significantly larger than the exercise Tc-99m MIBI estimates of defect mass (42 +/- 39.9 g; p less than 0.05).
 A linear correlation existed between stress thallium and technetium estimates of defect size (r = 0.85) but 15 of 24 Tc-99m MIBI defects were smaller than the Tl-201 defects.
 Partial redistribution of Tc-99m MIBI could explain the discordance.
 Stress Tc-99m MIBI SPECT defect size determined by visual interpretation or by the use of isocount analysis may be smaller than what is seen with stress Tl-201 SPECT.

1728,"From the parallel group design to the crossover design, and from the group approach to the individual approach.
 The consequences of heterogeneity in response to antihypertensive drugs for the clinical development programs of new antihypertensive drugs and for the care of the individual hypertensive patient have not previously been sufficiently recognized.
 They play a role in the inappropriate choice of too-high daily doses of some antihypertensive drugs at the end of extensive international development programs.
 They are also implicated in the insufficient control of blood pressure observed in the long-term multicenter trials in hypertension, where some patients have been treated for several years with drugs that were not the most appropriate for their disease and which did not adequately control their blood pressure.
 In addition to the parallel group studies, the use of double-blind two-period or multiple period crossover designs can provide valid data for the dose-finding of new antihypertensive drugs and their comparative evaluation.
 At the end of the trial, these designs also offer each patient the opportunity to be treated with the right dose of the drug most appropriate for his or her disease.

1659,"Myocardial perfusion imaging with technetium-99m sestamibi SPECT in the evaluation of coronary artery disease.
 Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi is a new myocardial perfusion imaging agent that offers significant advantages over thallium-201 (Tl-201) for myocardial perfusion imaging.
 The results of the current clinical trials using acquisition and processing parameters similar to those for Tl-201 and a separate (2-day) injection protocol suggest that Tc-99m sestamibi and Tl-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provide similar information with respect to detection of myocardial perfusion defects, assessment of the pattern of defect reversibility, overall detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) and detection of disease in individual coronary arteries.
 Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT appears to be superior to Tc-99m sestamibi planar imaging because the former provides a higher defect contrast and is more accurate for detection of disease in individual coronary arteries.
 Research is currently under way addressing optimization of acquisition and processing of Tc-99m sestamibi studies and development of quantitative algorithms for detection and localization of CAD and sizing of transmural and nontransmural myocardial perfusion defects.
 It is expected that with the implementation of the final results of these new developments, further significant improvement in image quality will be attained, which in turn will further increase the confidence in image interpretation.
 Development of algorithms for analysis of end-diastolic myocardial images may allow better evaluation of small and nontransmural myocardial defects.
 Furthermore, gated studies may provide valuable information with respect to regional myocardial wall motion and wall thickening.
 With the implementation of algorithms for attenuation and scatter correction, the overall specificity of Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT should improve significantly because of a substantial decrease in the occurrence of attenuation-related image artifacts.

2040,"The estimation of post-test probability of coronary disease following exercise testing using the sequential application of two Bayesian methods.
 Recent studies have revealed that Bayesian methods to estimate post-test probability following exercise testing differ in their sensitivity and specificity across the range of post-test probability.
 To take advantage of the relative strengths of each method, we combined two of these methods into a single method (DUAL BAYES) and compared it with the two original methods in 436 patients who underwent stress testing followed within 2 months by coronary arteriography.
 All patients had post-test probabilities determined using CADENZA (better sensitivity).
 Those CADENZA-derived probabilities greater than or equal to 50% were substituted with post-test probabilities determined by Diamond and Forrester's original TABULAR method (better specificity).
 Mean post-test probabilities were as follows: TABULAR 34, CADENZA 48, DUAL BAYES 37 (actual incidence 38%).
 Comparison of sensitivity and specificity at every fifth percentile of post-test probability revealed that the sensitivity of DUAL BAYES was better than that of TABULAR and equal to that of CADENZA at thresholds less than or equal to 10 and that the specificity was better than that of CADENZA and equal to that of TABULAR at thresholds greater than or equal to 60.
 Therefore using both methods as indicated above was better than using either method alone.

 Electrocardiographic signal-averaging during sinus rhythm (61 to 99 beats/min) and atrial pacing (100 to 171 beats/min) were performed to determine the effect of heart rate on late potentials in 15 patients without (group 1) and 7 patients with (group 2) inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT).
 In sinus rhythm (79 +/- 12 vs 77 +/- 12 beats/min, difference not significant), the duration of the low-amplitude signal less than 40 microV was longer in group 2 than group 1 (43 +/- 21 vs 26 +/- 8 ms, p = 0.034) and more patients had late potentials (57 vs 7%, p = 0.021), but QRS duration (121 +/- 32 vs 98 +/- 19 ms) and terminal voltage (33 +/- 33 vs 50 +/- 26 ms) were not significantly different.
 With atrial pacing in group 1 (128 +/- 16 beats/min), 3 patients developed a simultaneous decrease in terminal voltage and an increase in terminal QRS duration consistent with a late potential, but mean total and terminal durations were unchanged.

2051,"Physiology and pharmacology of cardiovascular catecholamine receptors: implications for treatment of chronic heart failure.
 In the sympathetic nervous system the physiologic effects of the endogenous catecholamines noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) are mediated by alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors (ARs).
 Both AR-types can be subdivided into two major subtypes: alpha-ARs into alpha-1 (predominant effect: vasoconstriction) and alpha-2 (presynaptic: inhibition of NA-release; postsynaptic: vasoconstriction), beta-ARs into beta-1 (cardiac effects, renal renin release, and lipolysis) and beta-2 (presynaptic: facilitation of NA-release; postsynaptic: vascular, bronchial, and uterine smooth muscle relaxation, glycogenolysis and possibly part of the A-mediated cardiac effects).
 During the last 30 years growing evidence has accumulated that dopamine (DA), the third endogenous catecholamine and the immediate precursor of NA, may also cause peripheral effects through stimulation of specific DA-receptors, in addition to its known action at alpha- and beta-ARs.
 It is now well accepted that at least two different DA-receptors are present in many peripheral tissues (DA1 and DA2), including those of the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous system.
 They seem to be involved in dilation of certain vascular beds, inhibition of NA-release during nerve stimulation, natriuresis, and aldosterone release.
 In chronic heart failure cardiac beta-AR function decreases (presumably due to endogenous ""down-regulation"" by the elevated catecholamines), and this decrease is related to the severity of heart failure (judged clinically by New York Heart Association functional class).
 The human heart contains both functional beta-1 and beta-2 ARs; cardiac beta-1 and beta-2 ARs seem to be differentially affected by different kinds of heart failure; in end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy beta-1 ARs are selectively reduced, whereas beta-2 ARs are nearly normal.

 Mean systolic (JM and WM, p less than 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (JM, p less than 0.002; WM, p less than 0.001) were associated with alcohol consumption in both groups.
 Compared to abstainers, the heaviest drinkers had the highest systolic (JM, p = 0.001; WM, p less than 0.01) and diastolic (JM, p less than 0.002; WM, p less than 0.05) blood pressures.
 The relation of blood pressure to alcohol intake was J-shaped in the Americans, but linear in the Japanese.
 Exploratory analyses revealed that the J-shape may have been due to under-reporting of heavy alcohol ingestion by American abstainers.
 When abstainers were excluded, the relationships were similar in both the American and Japanese.
 The positive association between blood pressure and alcohol consumption persisted after adjustment for age, cigarette smoking, use of antihypertensive medications, body mass index, heart rate, abdominal skinfold thickness, hematocrit, fasting blood glucose, serum uric acid levels and urinary sodium/potassium ratio.
 Alcohol use was also related to prevalence of hypertension.
 These findings confirm the presence of an independent association between alcohol intake and blood pressure in both JM and WM and suggest that, despite differences in the metabolism of alcohol, the relation of alcohol consumption to blood pressure is similar in both nationalities.

 After an initial titration period, the daily doses of enalapril ranged from 2.5 to 40 mg.
 At the end of the trial, 46% of the placebo-treated patients and 61% of the enalapril-treated patients were alive (p = 0.003); the survival figures at 8 months after completion of the trial were 32 and 48%, respectively (p = 0.001); and 21 and 30%, respectively (p = 0.006) at the 2-year follow-up.
 In the placebo group, there was a significant positive association between mortality and baseline levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, angiotensin II, aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide; no such association was found in the enalapril-treated patients.

2153,"Molecular defect of the band 3 protein in southeast Asian ovalocytosis 
 BACKGROUND.
 Southeast Asian ovalocytosis is a form of hereditary elliptocytosis in which the red cells are rigid and resistant to malaria invasion.
 The underlying molecular defect is unknown.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 We studied the red cells of 54 patients with ovalocytosis and 122 normal controls.
 We found that ovalocytes contain a structurally and functionally abnormal band 3 protein, the principal transmembrane protein of red cells.
 The structural lesion of ovalocyte band 3 was revealed by limited proteolytic cleavage of the protein, which produced fragments of abnormal size that were derived from the cytoplasmic domain of the protein.
 The structural lesion was present in all the subjects with ovalocytosis but none of the controls.
 This region of band 3 serves as the principal binding site for the membrane skeleton, a submembrane protein network composed of ankyrin, spectrin, actin, and protein 4.1.
 The structural defect is dominantly inherited, being tightly linked with the inheritance of ovalocytosis (the probability of linkage is in excess of 10 million to 1).
 Ovalocyte band 3 bound considerably more tightly than normal band 3 to ankyrin, which connects the membrane skeleton to the band 3 protein.
 This tight binding of ovalocyte band 3 to the underlying skeleton containing ankyrin was directly confirmed in intact cells by the finding that ovalocyte band 3 had markedly reduced lateral mobility in the membrane.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 The red cells in Southeast Asian ovalocytosis carry a structurally and functionally abnormal band 3 protein.
 This molecular defect may underlie the increased rigidity of the red cells and their resistance to invasion by malaria parasites.

 The persistence of a right umbilical vein is an uncommon finding, with only a dozen cases reported since 1826.
 The persistent right umbilical vein may replace the normal left umbilical vein or be supernumerary.
 The anomaly is associated with numerous and occasionally lethal malformations.
 In this series, only three of six fetuses (and another two in the literature) had no associated anomalies.
 All the others had a variety of associated lesions ranging from minor to lethal.
 The appearance at ultrasound is easy to recognize: The intrahepatic portion of the umbilical vein is lateral to the gallbladder, and the portal vein curves toward the stomach, instead of parallel to it.
 Since the recognition of the persistent right umbilical vein is simple and does not require additional scanning (it is visible in the section used to measure the abdominal perimeter), the author suggests using it as an indicator for more in-depth scanning.

 The repeating sequence of AMN-22 was similar but not identical to that determined for gut mucin.
 When examined by Northern analysis, the mRNA hybridizing to AMN-22 is extremely polydisperse in cystic fibrosis (CF) trachea, with apparent message length varying from approximately 2 kb to greater than 10 kb.
 A similar pattern was observed, with less abundant message, in CF bronchiectatic lung parenchyma.
 The lung cDNA hybridized to a similarly polydisperse message in ulcerative colitis colon RNA, but did not hybridize to control RNA from U937 lymphoma cells or stomach RNA.
 Pedigree analysis of restriction digests of genomic DNA revealed a pattern indicating a single polymorphic locus for the mucin gene expressed in the lung and the intestine.
 Southern analyses of human:mouse somatic cell hybrid cell lines allow a chromosomal localization for the mucin gene to human chromosome II, within the region 11p13-11pTer.
 Taken together, these data demonstrate that a polymorphic gene encodes a mucin core polypeptide expressed in both lung and intestine.

2185,"Intrauterine growth retardation: diagnosis based on multiple parameters--a prospective study.
 A scoring system has previously been developed to diagnose intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) based on three parameters: estimated fetal weight, amniotic fluid volume, and maternal blood pressure status.
 To test the IUGR score prospectively, the authors computed the score in 356 third-trimester fetuses, 39 growth retarded and 317 normal, scanned within 2 weeks prior to delivery.
 The IUGR score identified three groups, each with a distinct probability of IUGR: A score below 50 virtually excludes IUGR (3% probability), a score above 60 allows confident diagnosis (74% probability), and score of 50-60 is indeterminate (13% probability).
 The IUGR score performed best in patients with accurate dating by early ultrasound (US), but even among patients lacking accurate dating, the performance of the IUGR score was superior to that previously reported for any single sonographic parameter.
 The IUGR score can be used in any US facility to diagnose or exclude third-trimester IUGR.

2248,"Prevalence and sources of sensitization to emulsifiers: a clinical study.
 737 patients with suspected cosmetic- or medicament-related contact dermatitis were patch tested with 6 emulsifier agents: triethanolamine, cetyl stearyl alcohol, sorbitan sesquioleate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, and Amerchol L 101.
 39 patients (5.3%) gave 1 or more positive patch tests to emulsifiers.
 A total of 54 positive reactions were found, 23 of which were clinically relevant, triethanolamine being the most frequent sensitizer.
 Patients with emulsifier sensitivity generally give a high prevalence of positive patch tests to other common ingredients of topical preparations, such as preservatives or active ingredients.
 Cosmetics and topical medicaments were detected as the source of sensitization in an equal number of patients.
 Patch tests with patients' own causative preparations were frequently negative.
 To avoid overlooking emulsifier sensitivity, it is advisable to test these compounds in patients with contact dermatitis that is possibly due to topical preparations, regardless of whether they have other clinically relevant positive reactions or whether patch tests with their own products are negative.

2307,"Immunosuppressive effects of clonidine on the induction of contact sensitization in the balb/c mouse.
 The clonidine transdermal therapeutic system (clonidine-TTS) has been associated with a significant incidence of allergic contact sensitization.
 This incidence was not predicted by premarket skin sensitization testing in animals or humans.
 One possible explanation lies in recent findings in guinea pigs that clonidine exposure could inhibit the elicitation of skin reactions to unrelated strong contact sensitizers.
 However, these studies also showed that clonidine pretreatment did not appear to affect the induction of contact sensitization.
 On this basis, we sought to specifically evaluate the induction phase of sensitization to clonidine as an alternative means of assessing its sensitization properties.
 The method selected was the assay of in situ lymphocyte proliferation in lymph nodes draining the sites of clonidine exposure, a method recently promoted as an alternative means to assess contact allergenic potential.
 Utilizing various induction application techniques and regimens, we were consistently unable to demonstrate clonidine's allergenic potential through such an assessment of lymphocyte proliferation.
 We were also unable to demonstrate sensitization by in vivo ear swelling or in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis assay techniques.
 However, a subsequent assessment of the effect of clonidine exposure on the induction of sensitization to unrelated strong contact allergens demonstrated a consistent 40-70% inhibition of the proliferative response to the contact allergens oxazolone and trinitrochlorobenzene.
 This was similar to the degree of suppression produced by the corticosteroids fluocinonide and hydrocortisone when they were tested at 80 and 10 times lower concentrations.
 In addition, we observed a comparable inhibition of the ear swelling response to oxazolone.
 These data extend our knowledge of the immunomodulatory effects of clonidine and offer additional mechanistic insights into the failure of short-term predictive patch-test methods to detect this chemical's potential to induce allergic contact sensitization.

2317,"Aspirin, hydroxychloroquine, and hepatic enzyme abnormalities with methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis.
 Levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis from 5 centers involved in the Arthritis, Rheumatism, and Aging Medical Information System were correlated with the use of specific antirheumatic medications.
 Elevated levels of SGOT and SGPT were most frequent in patients taking salicylates and methotrexate (MTX) and least frequent in patients taking hydroxychloroquine.
 The combination of MTX and salicylates greatly increased the frequency of abnormal liver enzyme values.
 In contrast, the addition of hydroxychloroquine to a regimen of either MTX or aspirin essentially eliminated the SGOT and SGPT abnormalities.
 Results from all 5 centers were consistent and remained so after adjustment for age, sex, and disease duration.
 Knowledge of these important drug interactions may permit continuation of MTX therapy in patients in whom the drug might otherwise be discontinued.

2324,"Health status reports in the care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
 We examined the use of formal health status reports every 3 months over 1 year in the clinical care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
 The reports consisted of single-page, computer-generated summaries of scores derived from either the AIMS (Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales) or the MHAQ (Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire) health status questionnaires.
 A total of 1920 subjects from 27 community practice sites were randomly assigned to three study groups in each practice: intervention, attention placebo and control.
 Results showed that 55% of the physicians found the reports to be at least moderately useful as an aid to patient management, primarily for improving the doctor-patient relationship.
 However, no detectable differences among the three groups were seen in terms of medication compliance, number of physician visits, number of referrals, frequency of major medication changes, attitudes towards the physician, patient satisfaction or change in health status over 1 year.
 The failure to demonstrate objective benefits of health status reports in this study may be due to physician unfamiliarity with health status scores, failure to link the report with an office visit, the relative stability of clinical status in the subjects over 1 year and the relatively short time-frame of the study.

2320,"Spontaneous rheumatoid-like arthritis in a line of mice sensitive to collagen-induced arthritis.
 Twenty-eight percent of 13-month-old male mice of the high antibody responder line of Biozzi's selection I (HI) spontaneously developed a long-lasting inflammatory arthritis.
 This disease was clinically and histologically similar to human rheumatoid arthritis.
 The synovium of joints and some tendons was hypertrophied, with thickening of the synovial cell layer and infiltration by polymorphonuclear and mononuclear leukocytes.
 In some cases, synovial pannus formation led to destructive damage of articular cartilage and bone.
 Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, anti-DNA, and anti-type II collagen (CII) antibodies were often found in the sera of both arthritic mice and clinically normal littermates.
 The presence of CII autoantibodies in this line of mice suggests that a potentially harmful anti-CII T cell autoimmunity can also develop spontaneously and lead to joint damage.
 Moreover, HI mice are also susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis, while a closely related mouse line (HII) is resistant to both diseases.
 These data support the hypothesis that collagen-induced arthritis is pathogenetically related both to this spontaneous arthritis and to rheumatoid arthritis.

2267,"Severe phototoxic burn following celery ingestion.
 A 65-year-old woman developed a severe, generalized phototoxic reaction following a visit to a suntan parlor.
 History taking revealed that she had consumed a large quantity of celery root (Apium graveolens) 1 hour earlier.
 With the use of thin-layer chromatography, methoxsalen (8-methoxypsoralen) and 5-methoxypsoralen were identified in the extract from a similar celery root.
 The biologic activity of this extract, as evaluated with the semiquantitative Candida albicans inhibition technique, indicated a total psoralen dose of approximately 45 mg.
 Substantial amounts of psoralen may be absorbed from vegetables, such as celery, and under unusual circumstances, this may constitute a health hazard.

 Sera from 36 patients with scleroderma and 4 healthy control subjects were studied using 6 subcloned portions of topo I.
 Twenty-three sera recognized at least 2 independent epitopes on the molecule.

 Serial observations for up to 5 years of clinical score (a subjective global assessment), serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were analyzed in 3 groups of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) requiring treatment with a second line drug.
 The groups comprised 315 patients (243 women, 72 men) who had sulfasalazine (SAS); 203 patients (141 women, 62 men) who had sodium aurothiomalate (gold) and 163 patients (131 women, 32 men) who had penicillamine.
 The groups matched in most respects but the gold group had a smaller proportion of women, a shorter median disease duration and a higher median CRP than the remaining 2 groups.
 The penicillamine group contained a higher proportion of seropositive patients.
 In each group there were significant improvements in clinical score, CRP and ESR for all time points from 6 to 30 months; these improvements were maintained for longer (up to 60 months for SAS) in the SAS and gold groups but the differences between the drugs after 30 months were probably a consequence of falling number of patients, not differing drug potencies.
 The mean ESR and CRP levels fell to about 30 mm/h and 20-30 mg/l, respectively.
 Response was defined as (1) treatment duration greater than 6 months, (2) clinical score improvement greater than 4 by 6 months, (3) ESR fall to less than 30 mm/h by 6 months.
 By these criteria 142 of 681 patients (20.9%) responded; the response rates were SAS 20.3%, gold 24.1%, penicillamine 17.8%.

2466,"Amniotic fluid insulin concentration as a predictor of obesity.
 Longitudinal correlations were obtained between amniotic fluid insulin concentration at 32 to 38 weeks' gestation and anthropometric characteristics at the age of 6 years in 56 children of diabetic mothers.
 The prospective studies indicated that at the age of 6 years, as at birth, the greatest increase in weight in relation to height (relative obesity) was seen in children who experienced the greatest exposures to insulin in the uterus (as judged by amniotic fluid insulin concentration).
 Significant correlations between amniotic fluid insulin and relative obesity at the age of 6 years were found after adjustment for maternal obesity and macrosomia at birth.
 The highest amniotic fluid insulin values are clustered in the subgroup of 14 children who were obviously obese by the age of 6 years.
 These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that there is an association between anthropometric development and intrauterine metabolism, and suggest that premature and excessive exposure to insulin during gestation may predispose to obesity in childhood.
 The amniotic fluid insulin concentration may predict this eventuality.

2481,"Changes in phosphoinositide turnover, Ca2+ mobilization, and protein phosphorylation in platelets from NIDDM patients.
 Enhanced platelet functions have been demonstrated in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).
 This study evaluated abnormalities in platelet signal transduction in diabetic patients, including turnover of phosphoinositides, mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, and phosphorylation of 20,000- and 47,000-Mr proteins (P20 and P47).
 Washed platelets were obtained from 6 patients with NIDDM whose platelet aggregation rates were abnormally elevated (DM-A group), 11 NIDDM patients with normal platelet aggregation rates (DM-B group), and 8 age-matched healthy control subjects.
 The mass and specific radioactivity of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidic acid (PA) in 32P-labeled platelets were not different among the three groups.
 Hydrolysis of PIP2, PIP, and PI; accumulation of PA; and phosphorylation of P20 in platelets stimulated by 0.05 U/ml thrombin were significantly increased in the DM-A group compared with the control or DM-B group.
 There was no difference in P47 phosphorylation among the three groups.
 On the contrary, P20 and P47 phosphorylation induced by 50 nM of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C, was significantly decreased in the DM-A group.
 Additionally, the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) was measured with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura 2.
 Although the basal [Ca2+]i value was similar in the three groups, the rise in [Ca2+]i induced by 0.05 U/ml thrombin in the presence and the absence of extracellular Ca2+ was significantly higher in the DM-A group than the other groups.

2412,"Reduced insulinotropic effects of glucagonlike peptide I-(7-36)-amide and gastric inhibitory polypeptide in isolated perfused diabetic rat pancreas.
 The pathophysiological role of incretin in diabetes mellitus has not been established.
 We therefore examined the effects of glucagonlike peptide I-(7-36)-amide (truncated GLP-I) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) on insulin and glucagon release from isolated perfused pancreases of diabetic rats (12-14 wk of age, mean +/- SE fasting plasma glucose 8.9 +/- 0.6 mM, n = 25) after an injection of 90 mg/kg streptozocin on the 2nd day after birth and compared the results with those of nondiabetic control rats.
 In diabetic rats, the infusion of 1 nM GLP-I or GIP in perfusates with varying glucose concentrations (2.8, 5.6, 8.3, 11.1, or 22.2 mM) caused a nearly equal degree of insulin stimulation from a similar basal insulin level.
 Meanwhile, basal and GLP-I- or GIP-stimulated insulin release increased in correlation with the ambient glucose concentration in nondiabetic rats.
 The degree of stimulation of insulin release at glucose concentrations of 5.6 mM in diabetic rats was approximately 33% that of nondiabetic rats.
 The stimulation potency was the same between GLP-I and GIP.
 The insulin treatment for diabetic rats (5 U/kg NPH insulin at 0900 and 2100 for 6 days) brought only a slight improvement in the glucose dependency of GLP-I-stimulated insulin release.
 The effects of GLP-I and GIP on glucagon release were completely opposite.
 GLP-I suppressed release; GIP stimulated it.
 In diabetic rats, the degree of suppression by GLP-I and stimulation by GIP were almost the same with similar basal glucagon levels in the perfusate with varying glucose concentrations.

 The effects of 3 mo of treatment with a combination of glipizide and human proinsulin were studied in a small group of closely monitored patients.
 The patients had non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and poor glucose regulation, despite maximal sulfonylurea therapy.
 This was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in which there were three treatment groups who received either 20 mg glipizide given 30 min before breakfast and dinner and human proinsulin given subcutaneously at bedtime (n = 5), glipizide and human proinsulin placebo (n = 5), or glipizide placebo and human proinsulin (n = 5).
 Glycemic regulation was assessed by measurements of 24-h plasma glucose profiles and glycosylated hemoglobin.
 Our observations demonstrate that the combination of glipizide plus human proinsulin was more effective than either agent alone in controlling overall glycemia in patients with NIDDM.
 The data support the concept of use of an agent during the day that has its major effects postprandially and another agent at bedtime that is relatively hepatospecific.

 In vivo in the rat 1,25(OH)2D3 decreases and a low calcium increases PTH mRNA levels.
 We now report the effect of 3 and 8 wk of changes in dietary vitamin D and calcium on PTH mRNA levels.
 PTH mRNA levels were increased by 3 wk of calcium deficiency (five times), a vitamin D-deficient diet (two times), and combined deficiency (10 times), but not changed by high calcium.
 Vitamin D-deficient-diet rats' PTH mRNA did not decrease after a single large dose of 1,25(OH)2D3, but did decrease partially after repeated daily doses of 1,25(OH)2D3.
 Rats after a vitamin D-, calcium-deficient (-D-Ca) diet did not respond to changes in serum calcium at 1 h.
 Flow cytometry of isolated cells from parathyroid-thyroid tissue separated the smaller parathyroid from the larger thyroid cells and allowed an analysis of parathyroid cell number.
 In normal vitamin D/normal calcium (NDNCa) rats the parathyroid cells were 24.7 +/- 3.4% (n = 6) of the total cell number, whereas in -D-Ca rats they were 41.8 +/- 6.6% (n = 6) (P less than 0.05).
 That is, -D-Ca rats had 1.7 times the number of cells, whereas they had 10 times the amount of PTH mRNA, indicating the major contribution (6 times) of increased PTH gene expression per cell.
 Moreover, a calcium-deficient, more so than a vitamin D-deficient diet, amplifies the expression of the PTH gene, and vitamin D is necessary for an intact response of PTH mRNA to 1,25(OH)2D3 or calcium.

2348,"Randomized crossover study of effect of resistance training on glycemic control, muscular strength, and cholesterol in type I diabetic men.
 The goal of this study was to evaluate a program of resistance weight training on cardiovascular risk factors, blood glucose management, and overall strength in diabetic subjects.
 A randomized crossover design was performed on eight male type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects (mean +/- SD age 31 +/- 3.5 yr, height 176 +/- 5.6 cm, body wt 80 +/- 15 kg, duration of diabetes 12.3 +/- 9.8 yr, and insulin dose 24 U NPH/day and 21 U regular/day).
 The program consisted of heavy-resistance weight training 3 days/wk for 10 wk, concentrating on the strengthening of major muscle groups through progressive resistance.
 Blood tests included total cholesterol, triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and HbA1c.
 These tests were repeated at three time points during the program.
 Field-strength testing was performed before and after training.
 An improvement was seen in the squat (93.6% increase, P less than 0.0001) and bench press (58% increase, P less than 0.005).

2417,"Calcitonin gene-related peptide and induction of hyperglycemia in conscious rats in vivo.
 The effect of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on glucose metabolism was investigated in conscious and unrestrained rats in vivo.
 Intravenous injection of rat CGRP (5.67 and 0.567 nmol/kg) caused a significant, dose-dependent increase in plasma glucose concentration and a simultaneous dose-dependent increase in plasma insulin level.
 In contrast, plasma glucagon level was not changed.
 On the other hand, intravenous infusion of CGRP (46.6 pmol.kg-1.min-1) decreased tolerance to intragastric administration of glucose (IGGTT).
 Plasma insulin response to IGGTT, however, was not affected by CGRP infusion.
 Moreover, although intravenous injection of CGRP (5.67 nmol/kg) elicited a significant increase in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations, concomitant administration of epinephrine and norepinephrine, inducing a more prominent rise in plasma catecholamines than those induced by CGRP, affected neither plasma glucose nor insulin levels.
 Finally, plasma insulin levels obtained by simulating CGRP-induced changes in plasma glucose or glucose plus catecholamine levels by infusion of glucose or glucose plus catecholamines were not different from those induced by CGRP injection.
 These results suggest that CGRP has a hyperglycemic action that is not mediated by sympathetic outflow in conscious rats, and inhibition of insulin secretion, if any, does not play a major role in this hyperglycemic action of CGRP.
 We have demonstrated specific CGRP receptors linked to adenylate cyclase activation in rat liver plasma membranes; this hyperglycemic effect of CGRP in vivo may be partly due to its direct action on the liver.

2501,"Developmental adaptations in cytosolic phosphate content and pH regulation in the sheep heart in vivo.
 This study examines adaptations in myocardial cytosolic phosphate content and buffering capacity that occur in vivo as a function of development.
 Phosphate metabolites were monitored in an open chest sheep preparation using a 31P magnetic resonance surface coil over the left ventricle.
 Newborn lambs (aged 4-9 d, n = 5) underwent exchange transfusion with adult blood to reduce blood-borne 2,3-diphosphoglycerate contamination of the heart monophosphate and phosphomonoester resonances, thus allowing determination of these phosphate concentrations.
 The blood-exchanged newborns and mature controls (aged 30-60 d, n = 5) were infused with 0.4 N hydrochloric acid to decrease pH from greater than 7.35 to less than 7.00.
 Simultaneously, intracellular and extracellular pH were determined from the chemical shifts of the respective phosphate peaks and compared to arterial blood pH.
 Findings were as follows: (a) diphosphoglycerate contribution to the cardiac spectrum was found to be negligible, (b) significant decreases in cytosolic phosphate (P less than 0.03) and phosphomonoester (P less than 0.01) content occurred with maturation, and (c) large decreases in extracellular pH (greater than 0.5 U) in both groups were similarly associated with only small changes in intracellular pH (less than 0.1 U).
 Change in cytosolic phosphate content implies that alterations occur in the phosphorylation potential with resulting effects on regulation of myocardial respiration, and cardiac energetics.

2429,"Beta-cell cytoadherent lymphocytes in some subjects at risk for type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes: progression to diabetes within 2 years.
 The increased binding in vitro of CD3 CD4 T-lymphocytes from type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients to beta-cell membrane antigens compared to lymphocytes from control subjects was previously shown to be a marker of cell-mediated immunity, called diabetic rosettes.
 In the present study diabetic rosettes were detected in some subjects at risk for type 1 diabetes (first degree relatives of type 1 diabetic patients or nondiabetic subjects with previous transient hyperglycaemia).
 The mean number of lymphocytes adherent to beta-cells (beta-CL) was significantly higher in subjects at risk for type 1 diabetes than in age- and sex-matched control blood bank donors (P less than 10(-6].
 This number of beta-CL was higher in type 1 diabetic patients than in subjects at risk (P less than 10(-6], and one-way analysis of variance by rank (Kruskal-Wallis) revealed that the three populations (controls, diabetics, and risk subjects) were different in terms of beta-CL values (P less than 0.001).
 The percentage of subjects at risk that had a positive test (arbitrarily defined as a beta-CL value higher than the 95th percentile of 228 controls) was 20%.
 No difference was observed between the two subgroups of subjects at risk in terms of either mean +/- SEM of beta-CL or percentages of individuals with a positive test.
 These diabetic rosettes were slightly associated with acute insulin response to iv glucose lower than the 5th percentile of controls (immunoreactive insulin at 1 +/- 3 min, 250 pmol/L; by chi 2, P = 0.04) and with HLA DR 3/4 heterozygosity (by chi 2, P = 0.04).
 They were not associated with islet cell antibodies (regardless of the threshold for positivity, expressed in Juvenile Diabetes Foundation units), insulin autoantibodies, activated (HLA DR+) T-lymphocytes, or sex.
 A statistical association was detected between HLA DR 3/4 heterozygosity and a low acute insulin response to iv glucose (by chi 2, P less than 0.003).
 The preliminary (2-yr) longitudinal follow-up revealed that out of five islet cell antibody-positive subjects who progressed to type 1 diabetes, three displayed beta-CL values higher than the 90th percentile of controls.
 Diabetic rosettes could, thus, be detected in some individuals at risk for type 1 diabetes as a marker of cell-mediated immunity.

 T-cell responses, expressed as a stimulation index, to S-antigen and peptides were negative in all patients before treatment.
 Three weeks after panretinal laser photocoagulation, eight of 10 assays were positive (stimulation index greater than 2; P less than .01) when lymphocytes were stimulated with peptide BSA(273-292); six of nine were positive (P less than .01) with peptide BSA(303-332); and six of six were positive (P less than .001) with peptide BSA(343-362).

 The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of exercise on the rate of onset of hypoglycemia induced by infusion of excess insulin (0.8 mU.min-1.100 g-1).
 Rats were either fasted overnight (FS) or fed ad libitum (FD).
 FS rats were killed after 5, 10, or 15 min of infusion at rest or after running on the treadmill at 21 m/min and 15% grade.
 FD rats were killed after 10, 20, or 40 min of infusion at rest or after exercise.
 Rats were also killed 15 min postexercise for FS and 60 or 120 min postexercise for FD with continued insulin infusion.
 The progressive decline in blood glucose was not altered by exercise in the FS rats.
 FD rats showed a significant difference due to exercise only after 40 min (rest 4.2 +/- 0.3 mM, exercise 3.2 +/- 0.2 mM).
 A significant postexercise repletion of glycogen was observed in red vastus and soleus muscles of FD rats despite the decreasing blood glucose values.
 These data indicate that exercise accelerates the rate of development of hypoglycemia in FD rats.
 In the FS rats, where the rate of decline in blood glucose was greater, exercise had no effect on the time course of development of hypoglycemia.

2372,"Differences in lipoprotein subfraction composition and distribution between type I diabetic men and control subjects.
 Subfractions of very-low-density and low-density lipoproteins were examined in 10 male normolipidemic type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients before and after improvement of metabolic control and were compared with subfractions from male control subjects matched to the diabetic patients at entry for age, body mass index, plasma cholesterol, and plasma triglycerides.
 Two consistent differences in subfraction composition were noted between the diabetic patients at entry and the control subjects.
 First, subfractions from diabetic patients tended to be cholesterol-ester poor and triglyceride rich; this was particularly marked for the low-density lipoprotein subfractions.
 Second, the subfractions from pretreatment diabetic patients contained higher proportions of non-apolipoprotein B apolipoproteins.
 This compositional anomaly, but not the lipid modifications, responded to but was not completely normalized by improved glycemic control, which was also accompanied by reductions in the plasma concentrations of all subfractions.
 Treatment modified subfraction distribution so that the lipoprotein profile of posttreatment diabetic patients more closely resembled the profile observed in the control subjects.
 These changes were achieved without significant modification of daily insulin dose.
 In the context of blood lipid risk factors, the results argue for the need to maintain optimal insulinization even in apparently normolipidemic diabetic patients to avoid modifications of the lipoprotein pattern toward a potentially more atherogenic profile.

2493,"Immunological evidence for the accumulation of lipoprotein(a) in the atherosclerotic lesion of the hypoascorbemic guinea pig.
 Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an extremely atherogenic lipoprotein.
 Lp(a) has been found in the plasma of humans and other primates, but until now only in a few other species.
 The mechanism by which it exerts its atherogenicity is still poorly understood.
 We observed that Lp(a) has been found in the plasma of several species unable to synthesize ascorbate and not in other species.
 We have now detected apoprotein(a) in the plasma of the guinea pig.
 We induced atherosclerosis in this animal by dietary ascorbate depletion and, using SDS/PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting, we identified Lp(a) as accumulating in the atherosclerotic plaque.
 Most importantly, adequate amounts of ascorbate (40 mg per kg of body weight per day) prevent the development of atherosclerotic lesions in this animal model and the accumulation of Lp(a) in the arterial wall.
 We suggest an analogous mechanism in humans because of the similarity between guinea pigs and humans with respect to both the lack of endogenous ascorbate production and the role of Lp(a) in human atherosclerosis.

 To assess the contribution of the HepG2/erythrocyte glucose-transporter (HepG2 GT) gene to the inherited susceptibility to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), cDNA and genomic probes were used to search for restriction-endonuclease polymorphisms at this locus.
 Analysis of DNA from 16 unrelated Black American individuals with 19 enzymes and as many as six different probes, defined four polymorphisms over a 45-kilobase region.
 Nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.006) was low relative to that at other loci, with an average of 1 in 1700 base pairs different between two chromosomes at this locus.
 The observed combined heterozygosity for these four sites was 0.69, which indicates that the markers at this locus could be useful for linkage analysis in families.
 Linkage-disequilibrium values between the four polymorphisms were evaluated by pairwise analysis and extended haplotypes.
 Calculating pairwise associations by the disequilibrium statistic delta or by another measure of disequilibrium, D' (the maximum likelihood of disequilibrium, which is less dependent on frequency), significant linkage disequilibrium could not be demonstrated.
 However, the frequencies of the observed extended haplotypes were shown to differ (chi 2 = 9.1, df = 2, P less than 0.025) from predicted frequencies if the sites were in linkage equilibrium in Blacks.
 The frequencies of these four polymorphisms were determined in Black nondiabetic (n = 44) and NIDDM (n = 63) subjects.
 Neither the allelic nor genotypic frequencies of the polymorphisms differed between the two groups.

2523,"Lipoprotein and apolipoprotein levels in subclinical hypothyroidism. Effect of levothyroxine therapy.
 To assess whether subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with changes in lipoprotein fractions, 13 patients maintained in a stable state of subclinical hypothyroidism for at least 3 months were studied prior to and 2 and 4 months following restoration of a euthyroid state with incremental levothyroxine sodium therapy.
 Thyrotropin levels ( +/- SEM) had decreased from 16.6 +/- 3.2 mU/L to 3.1 +/- 0.7 mU/L and 3.2 +/- 0.7 mU/L at 2 months and 4 months.
 At 2 months, levothyroxine treatment led to a decrease in levels of total cholesterol from 5.5 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (213 +/- 12 mg/dL) to 4.8 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (186 +/- 12 mg/dL), in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from 3.7 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (143 +/- 12 mg/dL) to 2.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (112 +/- 12 mg/dL), and in apolipoprotein B from 91 +/- 8 mg/dL to 74 +/- 7 mg/dL.
 At 4 months, levels of LDL-C and apolipoprotein B remained significantly lower than pretreatment values (2.9 +/- 0.2 mmol/L [112 +/- 8 mg/dL] and 75 +/- 6 mg/dL, respectively).
 While high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), HDL3-C, and apolipoprotein A-I were not significantly affected by levothyroxine therapy, there was a slight trend of increase in HDL2-C during levothyroxine substitution.
 There was also a tendency for a decrease in triglyceride levels from 1.3 +/- 0.2 mmol/L (115 +/- 18 mg/dL) to 0.9 +/- 0.1 mmol/L (80 +/- 9 mg/dL) at 4 months of levothyroxine therapy.
 Levels of HDL-C tended to decrease from 4.8 +/- 0.4 mmol/L (186 +/- 15 mg/dL) to 4.5 +/- 0.5 mmol/L (174 +/- 19 mg/dL) at 2 months and to 3.9 +/- 0.4 mmol/L (151 +/- 15 mg/dL) at 4 months.
 The LDL-C/HDL-C ratio also decreased from 3.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (128 +/- 12 mg/dL) to 2.9 +/- 0.5 mmol/L (112 +/- 19 mg/dL) and 2.5 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (97 +/- 12 mg/dL) at 2 months and 4 months, respectively.
 These results suggest that long-term levothyroxine therapy in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with a decrease in LDL-C and apolipoprotein B levels that are reflected in a trend of decreases in cholesterol/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios known to have a relationship with coronary artery disease.

2530,"Cold follicles in a multinodular human goiter arise partly from a failing iodide pump and partly from deficient iodine organification.
 To investigate whether the common cold follicles in human multinodular goiters are the consequence of a functional defect of the apical membrane peroxidase, a failure of the iodide transport system, or both deficiencies, we studied iodide accumulation and iodine organification in 30 fragments of a large multinodular goiter transplanted to nude mice and labeled with 125I.
 Transplants were frozen to -80 C immediately after removal to avoid diffusion of inorganic iodide.
 Autoradiographic assessment of over 1000 cryosections (exposed either at -20 C or after thawing and washing out unbound iodide) showed two types of cold follicles, namely those that failed to accumulate iodide and, therefore, did not organify iodine, and those that readily accumulated iodide but failed to bind it, suggesting a failure of apical membrane peroxidase.
 The two types of pathogenetically different cold follicles coexisted in an apparently randomly intermingled fashion throughout the whole goiter.

2517,"Effects of converting-enzyme inhibition on barrier function in diabetic glomerulopathy.
 Differential solute clearances were used to examine the effects of a 90-day course of enalapril on glomerular barrier function in 16 proteinuric patients with diabetic glomerulopathy.
 By day 90, plasma renin and prorenin became elevated, and arterial pressure declined.
 Transglomerular passage of dextrans of broad size distribution (radii 28-60 A) was lowered significantly.
 In a subset of 8 patients, withdrawal of enalapril was followed after an additional 30 days by a return of renin levels and arterial pressure to pretreatment levels.
 The dextran-sieving profile also returned to baseline, becoming uniformly elevated above treated day-90 levels.
 A theoretical analysis of the serial dextran-sieving profiles indicated that enalapril shifted glomerular pore size distribution to smaller size.
 These changes in barrier size selectivity were associated with a reduction in fractional albumin and IgG clearances during enalapril therapy and a subsequent rise in these quantities after its withdrawal; urinary protein excretion rate tended to vary in parallel.
 We conclude that inhibition of converting enzyme in humans with established diabetic glomerulopathy diminishes glomerular permeability to proteins by enhancing barrier size selectivity.
 Because neither enalapril therapy nor its withdrawal influenced the glomerular filtration or renal plasma flow rates significantly, we propose that the primary action of enalapril may be to modulate the intrinsic membrane properties of the glomerular barrier.

2618,"Allergens as proteases: an Aspergillus fumigatus proteinase directly induces human epithelial cell detachment.
 Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is characterized by pulmonary and systemic allergic and inflammatory processes triggered by fungal antigens.
 Airway damage is a feature of this disorder, and although Aspergillus-derived proteinases have been described, the capacity of Aspergillus, however, to directly induce damage to human epithelium has not previously been studied.
 We therefore cultured Aspergillus fumigatus from two patients with ABPA, extracted mycelial products by sonication and filtration, and then evaluated their capacity to induce epithelial cell (EC) desquamation from basement membrane using an in vitro model that uses intact human amniotic EC and native basement membrane.
 A.
 fumigatus extracts induced detachment of EC in a dose-dependent fashion, producing up to 34% +/- 6% detachment (p less than 0.05 compared to medium alone).
 Enzyme analysis of A.
 Fumigatus extract using synthetic substrates revealed the presence of a number of different enzymes; therefore, studies with specific proteinase inhibitors were undertaken to identify the proteinase(s) responsible for detachment.
 A.
 Fumigatus-induced desquamation was partially inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride and substantially inhibited by glutathione and N-acetylcysteine, but not by alpha 1-antitrypsin, 1,10 phenanthroline, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, aprotinin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor at concentrations that inhibit other serine- or metalloproteinases.
 Gel filtration of the extract with a Sepharose 6B column revealed that the major epithelium-detaching activity appeared in the 20 to 35 kd fraction.
 Comparison with proteinase standards suggested a role for a chymotrypsin-like proteinase.
 Thus, A.
 fumigatus releases a proteinase that is directly able to induce EC detachment.

 Blood and tissue were studied for potential infectivity at autopsy of ten patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
 Special attention was paid to the possibility of detecting HIV in bone at craniotomy.
 Postmortem intervals were one to six days.
 Specimens for HIV isolation included skull bone, brain, blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph node, and cerebrospinal fluid in one case.
 HIV grew in culture from at least one specimen from eight autopsies, one of which was performed six days postmortem.
 HIV was recovered from the blood of five patients and the tissue of five patients, including three with negative blood cultures.
 Skull bone contained HIV in two cases.
 HIV also grew from native spleen specimens stored for up to 14 days postmortem at 20 degrees C.
 Recommended precautions, including those for bone, are indicated at autopsy of HIV-infected patients even after long postmortem intervals.

2584,"Bronchoconstriction induced by spirometric maneuvers in patients with bronchial asthma.
 We analyzed forced expiration maneuver-induced bronchoconstriction in 14 asthmatic patients and in seven normal subjects by breaking down the forced expiration maneuver of spirometry (the FVC maneuver) into two phases: a slow, deep inspiration to the total lung capacity (TLC) (the DI maneuver) and a forced expiration to the residual volume (RV) (the PFV maneuver).
 Specific airway conductance (sGaw) was measured at functional residual capacity (FRC) after each of the three maneuvers.
 All of the maneuvers caused the greatest bronchoconstriction immediately after completion of the maneuver.
 The mean decreases in the sGaw immediately after the FVC, DI, and PFV maneuvers were 45.0 +/- 6.6 (SD)% (P less than .001), 29.6 +/- 5.3% (P less than .001), and 16.7 +/- 5.3% (P less than .03), respectively.
 The decrease in sGaw by the FVC maneuver was very close to the combined algebraic sum of the DI maneuver and the PFV maneuver.
 The normal subjects did not show any changes in the sGaw by any of the maneuvers.
 The inhalation of albuterol almost abolished the response of bronchoconstriction to any of the three maneuvers, but inhalation of an anticholinergic agent, ipratropium bromide, did blunt the response.
 This study suggests that forced expiration maneuver-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatics can be caused not only by deep inspiration to the TLC but also by forced expiration to the RV, and that the bronchoconstriction may be brought about mainly by an increase in parasympathetic activity.

 Results indicated that Ag-specific suppressive activity was present in serum-free medium and this TsF could exhibit the characteristics ascribed to it by various groups: it could bind nominal Ag with specificity, it was bound by anti-TsF mAb, and it could mediate Ag-specific suppression both in vivo and in vitro.

 We derived a total of 146 T lymphocyte lines specific for human myelin basic protein (MBP) from the peripheral blood of 20 MS patients and from a control group of 12 healthy donors, and determined the reactivities of T cell lines by [3H]thymidine incorporation on exposure to MBP and MBP peptides 1-44, 45-89, and 90-170.
 We defined HLA restriction of the T lines by using monoclonal antibodies against monomorphic determinants on human HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP molecules.
 MBP-specific T cell lines could be isolated with a comparable efficiency from MS patients and healthy individuals.
 In both groups, MBP-specific T lymphocytes recognized at least 4 different epitopes in the MBP molecule, and specificities showed comparable patterns for different MBP peptides.
 MBP-specific T cell lines derived from MS patients and controls were restricted by DR products of the human major histocompatibility class II locus.
 Notable phenotypic differences of T cell lines existed between the 2 groups.
 Lines isolated from MS patients expressed predominantly the CD3+ CD4+ CD8- phenotype, while some control lines were composed of up to 87% CD3+CD4+CD8+ T lymphocytes.
 These findings illustrate the presence of MBP-specific T cells in MS patients and controls that are similarly sensitized to MBP and restricted by HLA-DR products.

2669,"A novel X-linked combined immunodeficiency disease.
 A novel X-linked combined immunodeficiency disease was found in five living males in an extended family in the United States.
 The age of the affected males ranged from 2.5 to 34 yr.
 The most prominent clinical abnormalities were a paucity of lymphoid tissue; recurrent sinusitis, otitis media, bronchitis, and pneumonia; severe varicella; and chronic papillomavirus infections.
 The principal immunologic features of the disorder were normal concentrations of serum immunoglobulins but restricted formation of IgG antibodies to immunogens; normal numbers of B cells and NK cells but decreased numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, particularly the CD45RA+ subpopulations; diminished proliferative responses of blood T cells to allogeneic cells, mitogens and antigens; and decreased production of IL-2 by mitogen stimulated blood lymphocytes.
 Thus, affected males in this family carry an abnormal gene on their X chromosome that results in a combined immunodeficiency that is distinct from previously reported disorders.

2554,"Rearrangement of immunoglobulin, T-cell receptor, and bcl-2 genes in malignant lymphomas in Hong Kong.
 The pattern of malignant lymphomas in the Hong Kong Chinese population is characterized by a low incidence of Hodgkin's disease and follicular lymphomas.
 The authors studied the immunoglobulin (Ig), T-cell receptor (TCR), and bcl-2 gene rearrangement in 62 cases of malignant lymphoma in this population by Southern blot hybridization.
 Two cases of Hodgkin's disease showed no rearrangement of the Ig and TCR genes.
 All 42 cases of B-cell lymphoma had Ig heavy chain (JH) rearrangement with or without additional rearrangement of the light chains (C kappa and C lambda).
 One case of diffuse B-cell lymphoma had additional T-cell receptor beta-chain (C beta) rearrangement.
 Sixteen of 18 cases of T-cell lymphoma had C beta rearrangement, and one case of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma had additional JH rearrangement.
 Two of eight (25%) cases of follicular lymphoma but only one of the 34 (2.9%) cases of diffuse B-cell lymphoma had bcl-2 rearrangement that was detected by pFL-1 probe.
 None of the 62 cases showed bcl-2 rearrangement using the pFL-2 probe.
 In conclusion, the Ig and TCR gene rearrangement pattern of the lymphomas found in Hong Kong correlates well with the T-cell and B-cell lineage, which is similar to reports in the white population.
 However, the incidence of bcl-2 gene rearrangement in follicular B-cell lymphoma is lower than that reported in the US but comparable with that in Japan.

2587,"Effect of long-term treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide) on airway hyperresponsiveness and clinical asthma in nonsteroid-dependent asthmatics.
 Several short-term studies have shown that inhaled steroids can reduce airway hyper-responsiveness in asthma.
 To evaluate whether prolonged treatment can bring about full recovery, this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial examined the effect of budesonide, 400 micrograms daily for 1 yr, on airway hyperresponsiveness.
 The time course and characteristics of improvements and associated changes in clinical asthma severity were also evaluated.
 Thirty-two stable adult asthmatics, requiring bronchodilators alone, were selected.
 Before and monthly throughout the study, airway responsiveness to methacholine was measured and clinical asthma severity assessed by questionnaire, daily bronchodilator use, and number of asthma exacerbations.
 Patients receiving budesonide showed a fourfold mean improvement in airway responsiveness compared with those receiving placebo (p less than 0.0005), whose responsiveness remained very stable.
 Fifteen of the 16 budesonide subjects improved and 5 returned to the normal range.
 Largest improvements occurred during the first 3 months but, in some, were still progressing slowly at 1 yr.
 Improvements in responsiveness were accompanied by significant improvements in asthma symptoms, bronchodilator use, and number of asthma exacerbations.
 The results show that regular, prolonged use of inhaled steroid can produce marked improvements in airway hyperresponsiveness, sometimes with full resolution, and these improvements are accompanied by clinically significant improvements in clinical asthma.

2695,"Regular inhaled beta-agonist treatment in bronchial asthma 
 89 subjects with stable asthma took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study of the effects of regular versus on-demand inhaled bronchodilator therapy.
 The subjects inhaled fenoterol or placebo by a dry powder delivery system for 24 weeks.
 Control of asthma was judged by daily morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates, symptom diaries, use of additional inhaled bronchodilator, and requirement for short courses of prednisone.
 Of 64 subjects who completed the trial, 57 showed a clear difference in degree of control of asthma between the fenoterol and placebo periods: in 17 (30% [95% confidence interval 18.4-43.4%]) asthma was better controlled during regular inhaled bronchodilator treatment, whereas in 40 (70% [56.6-81.6%]) control was better during placebo treatment with bronchodilator for symptom relief only.
 Mean airway responsiveness to methacholine increased slightly during the fenoterol period.
 The adverse effect of regular bronchodilator inhalation occurred not only among subjects who used a bronchodilator as sole treatment (2 were better and 10 were worse during regular bronchodilator treatment) but also among those who took inhaled corticosteroids (14 were better and 29 were worse).
 Thus, regular inhalation of a beta-sympathomimetic agent was associated with deterioration of asthma control in the majority of subjects.
 The trends to use of regular, higher doses or longer-acting inhaled beta-sympathomimetic treatment may be an important causal factor in the worldwide increase in morbidity from asthma.

 STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine if an educational program would improve both knowledge and practice of universal precautions by nursing personnel.
 DESIGN: Participants were given a 14-question test and observed for their, practice of universal precautions during routine IV catheter placement or phlebotomy and trauma care before and six months after an education in-service.
 SETTING: University hospital emergency department.
 TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Nursing personnel.
 INTERVENTIONS: One-hour lecture addressing the occupational risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the recommended use of universal precautions.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean overall correct response rates to the questionnaire before and after the in-service were 70% and 73%, respectively (P = NS).
 The pattern of incorrect responses suggested that the perceived risks of HIV transmission are underestimated, particularly among healthy-appearing patients.
 For care of critical trauma patients, there were significant increases between the frequency rates before and after the in-service of glove and protective eyewear use (66.7% vs 87.7%, P less than .025; 0.0% vs 17.3%, P less than .05, respectively).
 The frequency rates of glove use for IV placement or phlebotomy in noncritical patients and of gown use for trauma patient care also increased (52.6% vs 65.2% and 25% vs 39.5%, respectively); however, these changes were not statistically significant.
 CONCLUSION: An intensive educational program was associated with a modest increase in the compliance of ED nursing personnel with universal precautions and had no long-term effect on their general knowledge of HIV risk.
 The practice of universal precautions is still far from universal in this ED.

2569,"Polyclonal B cell activation in lupus-prone mice precedes and predicts the development of autoimmune disease.
 Polyclonal B cell activation is an early feature of autoimmune disease in humans and mice with systemic lupus erythematosus.
 The contribution of polyclonal activation to the progression of autoimmunity is unclear, however, since it precedes the development of end-organ damage by months or years.
 To examine this issue, 109 autoimmune-prone (NZB X NZW)F1 X NZB backcross mice were hemi-splenectomized at 10 wk and the number and antigenic specificity of their Ig-secreting B cells quantitated by ELISA spot assay.
 Of the 61 mice that had polyclonally increased numbers of Ig-secreting cells/spleen, 31 died by 6 mo.
 In contrast, 0/48 backcross mice with normal numbers of Ig-secreting B cells at 10 wk died over the same period (P less than 0.001).
 Polyclonally activated mice also developed proteinuria earlier and more frequently than littermates with normal numbers of Ig-secreting cells (P less than 0.001).
 As adults, backcross mice with proteinuria expressed repertoires skewed towards the production of anti-DNA antibodies.
 At 10 wk these same mice expressed repertoires marked by polyclonal activation rather than preferential anti-DNA production.
 These findings indicate that autoimmune disease in SLE is accompanied by the autoantigen-driven production of autoantibodies but is preceded and predicted by polyclonal B cell activation.

2622,"Ultraviolet cross-linking of helical oligonucleotides to two monoclonal MRL-1pr/1pr anti-DNA autoantibodies. Variations in H and L chain binding to DNA.
 Experiments were performed to determine whether both H and L chains of different anti-native DNA autoantibodies are uniformly involved in binding to DNA.
 Two purified monoclonal mouse (MRL-1pr/1pr) IgG autoantibodies, H241 and 2C10, were tested.
 They both bound synthetic helical oligonucleotides of 10 to 20 base pairs in a gel electrophoresis retardation assay but differed in their preferences for given base sequences.
 Exposure of antibody-radiolabeled oligonucleotide mixtures to UV light (254 nm) for 10 min led to specific covalent cross-linking of oligonucleotide to both the H and the L chains of H241 but only to the H chain of 2C10.
 Single labeling events were detected without higher aggregation.
 The oligonucleotides were not cross-linked to unrelated IgG, even after 2 h of irradiation.
 Cross-linked (radioactively labeled) H and L chains of H241 and 2C10 were isolated from denaturing electrophoresis gels and digested with lysyl endopeptidase and/or staphylococcal V8 protease.
 H241 and 2C10 H chains each yielded a major labeled peptide fragment, but the peptides from the two antibodies were different.
 These experiments measured only some of the antibody-DNA interactions, probably with bases in the major groove of the DNA.
 They indicated that two MRL-1pr/1pr IgG anti-native DNA antibodies differ in their H and L chain contacts with DNA and provide an approach to identifying affinity-labeled binding sites in the antibodies.

 Regional in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides quantitative data on selected chemical constituents of brain.
 We imaged 16 volunteers with clinically definite multiple sclerosis on a 1.5 tesla magnetic resonance scanner to define plaque-containing volumes of interest, and obtained localized water-suppressed proton spectra using a stimulated echo sequence.
 Twenty-five of 40 plaque-containing regions provided spectra of adequate quality.
 Of these, 8 spectra from 6 subjects were consistent with the presence of cholesterol or fatty acids; the remainder were similar to those obtained from white matter of normal volunteers.
 This early experience with regional proton spectroscopy suggests that individual plaques are distinct.
 These differences likely reflect dynamic stages of the evolution of the demyelinative process not previously accessible to in vivo investigation.

 The catheter balloons were punctured by pricking with a hypodermic needle.
 The overall incidence of free fragment formation was 27.3%.
 For both types of catheter examined, increasing balloon volume was not associated with an increased risk of free fragment formation following puncture.
 However, increasing volume was associated with increased free fragment formation when the balloon burst spontaneously.

 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate emergency medical services (EMS) system use, injury mechanisms, and prehospital assessments among elderly victims of trauma.
 DESIGN: We analyzed all prehospital data for injuries among patients 70 years old or older for whom 911 EMS dispatch was requested in a medium-sized metropolitan area during a 12-month period.
 RESULTS: A total of 1,154 cases occurred (women, 65.1%), which represented 30.3% of all 911 dispatches involving elderly patients.
 Injury mechanisms were fall (60.7%), motor vehicle accident (MVA; 21.5%), fight (2.4%), accidental poisoning (2.3%), and choking (2.1%).
 Persons in their 90s had a lower frequency of MVAs (3.4%) than did younger patients (23.0%) (P less than .005).
 The most frequent injuries determined by prehospital assessment were head or face (25.1%), upper extremity (17.2%), hip (14.5%), lower extremity (13.8%), back (9.8%), and chest or abdomen (5.0%).
 The frequency of serious neurologic injuries was less for falls or MVAs than for other mechanisms (P less than .005).
 Suspected hip (P less than .001) and pelvic (P less than .005) injuries occurred more frequently during falls than during other mechanisms of injury, whereas back injuries occurred most frequently in MVAs (P less than .001).
 Seventy-one fall victims (10.1%) had suspected medical causes of their fall.
 Twelve patients (1.0%) were in cardiac arrest.
 CONCLUSION: We report injury patterns and mechanisms among elderly victims of trauma presenting to an EMS system.

 In fifteen patients, a subtle injury of the Lisfranc joint (tarsometatarsal articulation) was found.
 The lesion was defined as a diastasis of two to five millimeters between the bases of the first and second metatarsals, as seen on anteroposterior radiographs.
 There often was a long delay between injury and diagnosis.
 Eight patients were treated with a below-the-knee cast only, three had treatment with a cast and then tarsometatarsal arthrodesis, two had no initial treatment but later had arthrodesis, and two had open reduction and internal fixation.
 The duration of follow-up ranged from two to thirteen years after the diagnosis.
 There was no correlation between the severity of the diastasis and the patient's functional result.
 Marked disability and pain persisted in seven patients, and six of them had flattening of the longitudinal arch.
 Maintenance of the longitudinal arch usually was associated with a better functional outcome.
 When a patient has a subtle injury of the Lisfranc joint, weight-bearing lateral radiographs of both feet are needed to identify flattening of the longitudinal arch.
 Such radiographs should be made routinely in the evaluation of all injuries of the foot that may involve the Lisfranc joint.

2876,"The radial forearm flap for reconstruction of the upper extremity.
 The radial forearm flap, owing to its good-caliber arteries of long length and equally well distributed venous system, has proved very reliable.
 It has not only earned its place and recognition in reconstructive hand surgery, but also has emerged as a workhorse for the microvascular surgeon.
 We have used 14 radial forearm flaps for upper extremity reconstruction, and we present herein our experience.
 The technique of extracorporeal tissue transfer, which has been published elsewhere, was used in two patients and is detailed.
 Four representative patients are presented.

2886,"Overcoming potential pitfalls in the use of Medicare data for epidemiologic research.
 We used Medicare data bases and US Census data to address two questions critical to the use of Medicare files for epidemiologic research.
 First, we examined the degree to which the population enrolled in the Medicare program is similar to the elderly resident population of the United States, as estimated by the US Census.
 We found small differences in the total population estimates but substantial differences by age and race.
 Second, we found that among Medicare enrollees, physician claims identify a small proportion of hip fracture cases which are not documented in the hospital discharge files.
 This proportion varies by age, region, and state within the United States.
 Calculation of rates based on Medicare hospital discharge data, and probably other hospital discharge data sets as well, must take these limitations into account.
 Use of all available Medicare data files can overcome these limitations.

2945,"Early detection of myocardial contusion and its complications in patients with blunt trauma.
 Myocardial contusion remains an elusive clinical entity, which consumes a disproportionate amount of scarce and expensive critical care resources for the purpose of cardiac monitoring.
 This study attempts to define a group of patients at high risk who can be identified from the available data present at the time of admission.
 All patients admitted with the suspicion of a myocardial contusion over a 3-year period were retrospectively studied.
 The records were examined for history, physical findings, electrocardiographic (ECG) results, creatine kinase levels, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and echocardiographic findings.
 A diagnosis of a myocardial contusion was made if patients had an ECG consistent with acute injury, increased creatine kinase-MB, or an abnormal echocardiogram consistent with acute injury.
 Patients were stratified into two groups: Group 1 patients satisfied the criteria for a myocardial contusion and Group 2 patients lacked sufficient evidence to substantiate this diagnosis.
 The records were then examined for the presence of factors available in the emergency room that might be predictive of a myocardial contusion or its complications.
 A total of 88 patients were evaluated; 27 of these were found to have a myocardial contusion (Group 1) with 61 patients placed in Group 2 (no myocardial contusion).
 Group 1 patients had an abnormal admission ECG (p less than 0.05), and an ISS greater than or equal to 10 (p less than 0.05).
 Multivariate analysis identified two factors predictive of a myocardial contusion: an abnormal ECG and an ISS greater than 10.
 When these two predictors were absent, the probability of a myocardial contusion was 1%.
 No predictors of a complication of a myocardial contusion were identified.
 These data suggest that a combination of easily obtained variables in the emergency department can be used to select a patient population at high risk for myocardial contusion.
 Prospective evaluation of these variables is necessary.

2881,"Traumatic disruptions of the thoracic aorta: treatment and outcome.
 Of 27 patients admitted to our level I trauma center with acute disruption of the thoracic aorta, two patients died of exsanguination before aortic repair.
 One patient had massive leakage from the aneurysm after aortography and died during surgery.
 All patients suffered from multiple injuries.
 Eighty-three percent of the patients had major operations in addition to the aortic repair.
 ""Clamp and sew"" technique was used in 18 patients (75%), two of whom had multiple tears of the aortic arch.
 Heparin-coated shunts were used in five patients (20.8%), and a cardiopulmonary bypass was performed in one patient who had multiple tears.
 Three postoperative deaths were related to polytrauma, cardiogenic shock, and sepsis.
 Paraplegia developed in three patients, two of whom had multiple aortic lesions necessitating longer ischemia time during the repair.
 Only one patient had complete neurologic deficit at the 1-year follow-up.
 In our series, neither surgical procedure proved superior.
 We conclude that the ""clamp and sew"" technique for repair of the disrupted thoracic aorta may allow for a more favorable outcome.

 Unfamiliarity of physicians with chilblains (perniosis) gives rise to unnecessary hospital admissions with expensive laboratory and radiologic evaluations and, at times, hazardous therapy.
 Seven cases of chilblains were seen in San Francisco from November 1986 through January 1987.
 The patients presented with pruritic, at times painful, purple acral patches or plaques on the fingers, toes, and nose after exposure to a cool or a cold, damp environment.
 Histologic examination in two cases revealed a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with endothelial swelling of the subcutaneous fat and of the upper and lower dermal plexus.

2788,"Selective monitoring of patients with suspected blunt cardiac injury.
 Blunt chest trauma can result in cardiac injury with consequent dysrhythmias, valve malfunction, or frank rupture.
 Typically, patients with blunt chest trauma and suspected cardiac injury have required cardiac monitoring for 48 to 72 hours.
 Predicting which patients with blunt chest trauma are not at risk for cardiac complications would obviate many patient-hours of monitoring in the intensive care unit.
 This series examines the sensitivity of two-dimensional surface echocardiography in predicting cardiac complications.
 Over a 24-month period, 115 patients were admitted with blunt chest trauma and prospectively evaluated for cardiac injury with admission electrocardiograms, serial creatine kinase isoenzyme studies, and two-dimensional echocardiography.
 Thirty-one patients (27%) had abnormal two-dimensional echocardiograms.
 In 8 (25.8%) of these patients, cardiac complications requiring treatment developed.
 Eighty-four patients (73%) had normal two-dimensional echocardiograms, and a cardiac complication requiring treatment developed in only 1 (1.2%) of them.
 Of the 9 patients who required treatment of cardiac complications, 3 had normal admission electrocardiograms and only 1 had elevated levels of the myocardial-specific isoenzymes of creatine kinase.
 We believe two-dimensional echocardiography is a sensitive test for evaluating cardiac injury resulting from blunt chest trauma and is helpful in selecting those patients who require monitoring in the intensive care unit.

2908,"The lateral arm fascial free flap: its anatomy and use in reconstruction.
 Free fascial transfer has been used for reconstruction of gliding surfaces of the upper and lower extremities or when thin, pliable coverage is required (hand, heel, nose, and ear).
 In our experience with the lateral arm fasciocutaneous flap, we have found that the fascia alone is an excellent source of tissue for free flap transfer.
 A thorough investigation of the microscopic, gross, and radiographic anatomy of the lateral arm fascia was undertaken by the study of 25 fresh cadavers.
 Vascular pathways were mapped, their locations were analyzed, and then they were correlated with the elevation, design, and transfer of the flap.
 The lateral arm has a large fascial component located anterior and posterior to the lateral intermuscular septum, which itself lies between the triceps and the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles.
 It is perfused by the posterior radial collateral artery (PRCA), one of the terminal branches of the profunda brachii.
 This vessel (PRCA) provides at least four fascial branches from 1 to 15 cm proximal to the lateral epicondyle, the largest of which is located an average of 9.7 cm superior to the lateral epicondyle.
 Fascia up to 12 x 9 cm may be used with good axial perfusion.
 The histologic cross sections demonstrate the complex anatomy of the fascia itself, as well as its relation to the nutrient vessels.
 We have applied the lateral arm fascial flap in five cases of upper extremity reconstruction.
 We have also found this flap valuable in preservation of underlying anatomic detail for total reconstruction of the ear and nose when local tissue and more conventional flaps were not available.

2909,"A profile of alcohol and prescription drug abuse in a high-risk community-based elderly population.
 Substance abuse among the elderly is relatively common but often remains undetected or ignored by health and social workers.
 Psychosocial and health factors related to the aging process are the major contributors to alcoholism and other drug abuse.
 It is estimated that between two and ten percent of individuals over the age of 60 suffer from alcoholism.
 This article profiles alcohol and prescription drug abuse among the geriatric clientele of Elderly Services of Spokane (ESS), a division of the Spokane (Washington) Community Mental Health Center.
 In addition to traditional channels, ESS uses a unique gatekeeper network to identify high-risk, community-based elderly.
 Elderly persons referred by gatekeepers are regarded as ""hidden"" elderly and at highest risk; notably, 37 percent of ESS clients are referred via this mechanism.
 Case management records of 1668 ESS clients were reviewed for a history of alcoholism, and a total of 161 persons (9.6 percent) were diagnosed with either primary or secondary alcohol abuse.
 Fifty subjects (about five percent of the average active ESS caseload) were referred for prescription drug abuse.
 Misused prescription drug classes were sedative-hypnotics, antianxiety agents, and analgesics.
 Diazepam, codeine, meprobamate, and flurazepam were the top four agents, and 92 percent of the subjects were found to have a duration of prescription drug abuse in excess of five years.
 A 60 percent correlation between prescription drug abuse and previous or active alcoholism was found.
 Additional characteristics of the geriatric study population are discussed in detail, including specific psychosocial factors, source of referral, age, gender, living situation, marital status, psychiatric history, and presence of polypharmacy.

2888,"Rapid visual colorimetry of peritoneal lavage fluid.
 STUDY HYPOTHESIS: That visual colorimetry can be used to rapidly and precisely estimate the erythrocyte count of 1:5 dilutions of simulated peritoneal lavage fluid.
 POPULATION: Fifty-four normal adult human subjects.
 METHODS: The automated or chamber RBC count is often used on fluid obtained by peritoneal lavage in patients with abdominal trauma to help determine the need for surgery.
 Unfortunately, this method sometimes results in excessive delay.
 We designed and built a simple colorimeter that facilitated rapid direct visual comparison of unknown samples with known color standards.
 A radiograph view box was used as a light source.
 Standards were prepared in 16-mm glass tubes to simulate peritoneal lavage fluid with RBC counts ranging from 0 to 140,000 in 10,000 cell/microL increments; 1:5 dilutions with water were used throughout to reduce opacity.
 Thimerosal was added to unknowns and standards to stabilize color; all samples were kept refrigerated at 4 C when not in use.
 In a double-blind in-vitro study, each subject matched 20 randomly distributed unknowns ranging from 12,000 to 131,000 erythrocytes/microL to the nearest standard.
 RESULTS: The mean absolute error for all 1,080 determinations was 3,560 RBC/microL (95% CI = 4,290-4,830; SD = 4,560; t = 39.6; df = 1,079; P less than .001).
 This method correctly predicted the RBC count to within 9,000 cells/microL 95% of the time.
 CONCLUSION: Visual comparison of 1:5 dilutions of simulated peritoneal lavage fluid with known color standards can be used to rapidly and precisely estimate the erythrocyte count.

2794,"Laboratory tests in the follow-up of treated alcoholics: how often should testing be repeated?
 The study group consisted of 60 male and 13 female alcohol-dependent employed patients who participated in inpatient treatment for alcoholism.
 They were followed up bimonthly for eight months after the treatment period.
 The results with GGT, ASAT, ALAT, MCV and the combination of GGT and MCV were studied with respect to the effect of taking the tests once (at eight months), twice (once every four months) or four times (bimonthly).
 According to our definition, the treatment outcome was good when the laboratory test values were within the normal range during the whole follow-up period.
 The differences in observed outcome (at eight months after treatment) were small whether one took the tests once at the end of the follow-up period or up to four (i.e.
 bimonthly) times.
 Nevertheless, there were some differences between the laboratory markers.
 To get the most accurate picture of drinking during the follow-up period one should repeat the test bimonthly with ASAT or ALAT, once every four months with GGT (or combined GGT and MCV), and once after eight months with MCV.
 When the time course of relapses is important for the study the more frequent test taking is also indicated.

2978,"A borna virus cDNA encoding a protein recognized by antibodies in humans with behavioral diseases.
 Borna disease virus (BDV) causes a rare neurological disease in horses and sheep.
 The virus has not been classified because neither an infectious particle nor a specific nucleic acid had been identified.
 To identify the genome of BDV, a subtractive complementary DNA expression library was constructed with polyadenylate-selected RNA from a BDV-infected MDCK cell line.
 A clone (B8) was isolated that specifically hybridized to RNA isolated from BDV-infected brain tissue and BDV-infected cell lines.
 This clone hybridized to four BDV-specific positive strand RNAs (10.5, 3.6, 2.1, and 0.85 kilobases) and one negative strand RNA (10.5 kilobases) in BDV-infected rat brain.
 Nucleotide sequence analysis of the clone suggested that it represented a full-length messenger RNA which contained several open reading frames.
 In vitro transcription and translation of the clone resulted in the synthesis of the 14- and 24-kilodalton BDV-specific proteins.
 The 24-kilodalton protein, when translated in vitro from the clone, was recognized by antibodies in the sera of patients (three of seven) with behavioral disorders.
 This BDV-specific clone will provide the means to isolate the other BDV-specific nucleic acids and to identify the virus responsible for Borna disease.
 In addition, the significance of BDV or a BDV-related virus as a human pathogen can now be more directly examined.

2971,"Synergism between hepatic injuries and a nonhepatotropic reovirus in mice. Enhanced hepatic infection and death.
 Reovirus type 1, after intravenous inoculation in the adult mouse, is secreted via bile into the intestine in an infectious form.
 Although reovirus type 1 is rapidly removed from systemic circulation by the liver and the lung, very few hepatocytes express reovirus antigen during infection.
 In intestinal cells, reovirus replicates selectively in the crypts.
 This site preference may be due to active cell proliferation in the crypts.
 We hypothesized that the state of the cell may affect virus replication and tested this hypothesis by using chemical and surgical means to increase hepatic mitotic activity.
 Adult mice were treated with carbon tetrachloride or surgical trauma, inoculated with reovirus type 1 intravenously, and subsequently killed.
 Virus antigen was identified using a highly specific immunohistochemical technique.
 Liver sections were stained using immunoperoxidase with specific rabbit antireovirus antibody.
 Hepatotoxin and surgical trauma increase reovirus antigen detection in both Kupffer cells and hepatocytes.
 Only the sequential administration of CCl4 and virus caused mortality at doses sublethal for each alone.
 These data demonstrate a synergism between hepatic injury and reovirus which results in a significant increase in the magnitude of viral infection and contributes to mortality.
 Such synergism may be important in idiopathic liver disease.

2979,"Evidence against a requisite role for defective virus in the establishment of persistent hepadnavirus infections.
 The factors involved in the establishment of persistent hepadnavirus infection are poorly understood.
 Recent findings demonstrate that the sequence of the genome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is variable in infected individuals and that, in some cases, virus mutants predominate.
 Our objectives in the present study were to analyze the variability of woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) genomes in an infected animal and to determine whether sequence heterogeneity played a critical role in the ability of WHV to induce chronic infection.
 We cloned and determined the complete nucleotide sequence of three supercoiled genomes from an animal that became infected after inoculation with a standardized WHV serum pool (i.e., the WHV7 virus pool).
 We found that there were four nucleotide substitutions among the three genome sequences as well as a 73-nucleotide deletion in one of the recombinants.
 DNA transfection experiments revealed that only one of the three recombinants was capable of independent replication.
 These data suggest that a significant proportion of replicative templates in woodchucks that are infected with WHV are defective virus genomes.
 Next, we compared the outcome of acute infection after inoculation with a serum pool containing a uniform population of replication competent virus (i.e., the WHV7R pool) with a serum pool composed of WHV genomes of variable sequence.
 The WHV7R serum pool originated from a woodchuck that became a chronic carrier after in vivo transfection of the liver with the infectious WHV7 recombinant.
 Neonatal woodchucks were inoculated with 5 x 10(6) WHV genome equivalents of either the WHV7 pool or the WHV7R pool.
 All animals in the study became acutely infected with WHV.
 Of the animals infected with the WHV7 serum pool, 65% became chronic carriers, while 80% of the animals infected with the WHV7R serum pool developed chronic infection.
 Thus, infection of woodchucks with a serum pool containing defective virus resulted in a rate of chronic WHV infection that was similar to, or even lower than, a rate from a pool containing only wild-type virus.
 This suggests that the presence of defective virus in the inoculum is not a prerequisite for the establishment of persistent hepadnavirus infections.

2973,"Effects of a 2.15-micron laser on human atherosclerotic xenografts in vivo.
 The thulium-holmium-chromium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (THC:YAG) laser has a tissue effect similar to that of the CO2 laser, with the advantage of transmissibility through flexible fibers.
 The authors used a human-rabbit xenograft model to evaluate the thrombotic and healing responses of atherosclerotic vessels subjected to laser energy.
 Occluded atherosclerotic human coronary artery segments were recanalized in vitro by use of the THC:YAG laser.
 Destruction of plaque by the laser was achieved with minimal collateral thermal damage.
 These vascular segments were then transplanted into the rabbit abdominal aorta.
 The authors observed that the luminal surface of the lased vessels was more thrombogenic than that of the nonlased control vessels.
 However, occlusion of the lased vessels did not occur.
 Repair of laser-treated tissue progressed until a mature, nonthrombogenic fibrin-platelet aggregate was adherent to the luminal wall.
 Overall, the lased vessels behaved in a fashion similar to the nonlased control vessels.
 On the basis of these results, the authors believe that the THC:YAG laser may have use in human angioplasty.

3025,"Cytogenetic analysis of 750 spontaneous abortions with the direct-preparation method of chorionic villi and its implications for studying genetic causes of pregnancy wastage.
 Altogether, 750 cases of spontaneous abortion between the fifth and 25th week of gestation were analyzed cytogenetically by the direct-preparation method using chorionic villi.
 The majority of cases (68%) were derived from early abortions before the 12th week of gestation.
 The frequency of abnormal karyotypes was 50.1%; trisomy was predominant (62.1%), followed by triploidy (12.4%), monosomy X (10.5%), tetraploidy (9.2%), and structural chromosome anomalies (4.7%).
 Among trisomies, chromosomes 16 (21.8%), 22 (17.9%), and 21 (10.0%) were prevalent.
 The frequency of chromosomally abnormal abortions increased with maternal age but only because of an increase of trisomy.
 Polyploidy and monosomy X, however, decreased.
 Mean maternal age was significantly increased for trisomies 16, 21, and 22 and was highest for trisomies 18 and 20.
 The results obtained are within the range of variability reported earlier from tissue culture-type studies.
 A consistent feature during our study is the excess of females in chromosomally normal abortions (male:female sex ratio 0.71).
 According to the methodology applied, maternal cell contamination and undetected 46,XX molar samples cannot have influenced the sex ratio.
 However, a bias introduced by social status or maternal age cannot be excluded.
 With the more rapid and convenient direct preparation of chorionic villi, reliable cytogenetic data on causes of spontaneous abortions can be obtained.

 In the avascular hepatic resection group there was no mortality; hypotension did not occur at the time of hepatic vascular isolation; rapid, accurate excision of the hepatic lesions could be achieved in a bloodless field; resection of midline lesions and those involving the great veins was possible; and ""segmentectomies,"" or resections crossing segmental boundaries, could be performed where previously formal hepatic lobectomies were required.

3170,"MyoD induces growth arrest independent of differentiation in normal and transformed cells.
 MyoD is a gene involved in the control of muscle differentiation.
 We show that MyoD causes growth arrest when expressed in cell lines derived from tumors or transformed by different oncogenes.
 MyoD-induced growth inhibition was demonstrated by reduction in the efficiency of colony formation and at the single-cell level.
 We further show that MyoD growth inhibition can occur in cells that are not induced to activate muscle differentiation markers.
 The inhibitory activity of MyoD was mapped to the same 68-amino acid segment necessary and sufficient for induction of muscle differentiation, the basic-helix-loop-helix motif.
 Mutants with alterations in the basic region of MyoD that fail to bind or do not activate a muscle-specific enhancer inhibited growth; mutants with deletions in the helix-loop-helix region failed to inhibit growth.
 Thus, inhibition of cell growth by MyoD seems to occur by means of a parallel pathway to the one that leads to myogenesis.
 We conclude that MyoD is a prototypic gene capable of functionally activating intracellular growth inhibitory pathways.

3009,"Rhodopsin mutants that bind but fail to activate transducin.
 Rhodopsin is a member of a family of receptors that contain seven transmembrane helices and are coupled to G proteins.
 The nature of the interactions between rhodopsin mutants and the G protein, transduction (Gt), was investigated by flash photolysis in order to monitor directly Gt binding and dissociation.
 Three mutant opsins with alterations in their cytoplasmic loops bound 11-cis-retinal to yield pigments with native rhodopsin absorption spectra, but they failed to stimulate the guanosine triphosphatase activity of Gt.
 The opsin mutations included reversal of a charged pair conserved in all G protein-coupled receptors at the cytoplasmic border of the third transmembrane helix (mutant CD1), replacement of 13 amino acids in the second cytoplasmic loop (mutant CD2), and deletion of 13 amino acids from the third cytoplasmic loop (mutant EF1).
 Whereas mutant CD1 failed to bind Gt, mutants CD2 and EF1 showed normal Gt binding but failed to release Gt in the presence of guanosine triphosphate.
 Therefore, it appears that at least the second and third cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin are required for activation of bound Gt.

3050,"The alien hand sign. Localization, lateralization and recovery.
 The alien hand sign was first described by Brion and Jedynak as a ""feeling of estrangement between the patient and one of his hands."" The affected hand frequently shows a grasp reflex and an instinctive grasp reaction as well as elements of what Denny-Brown referred to as a ""magnetic apraxia"" associated with frontal lobe damage.
 Most notably, however, the affected hand is observed to perform apparently purposive behaviors that are perceived as being outside the volitional control of the patient.
 The patients interpret the behavior of their own affected limb as being controlled by an external agent.
 They do not feel that they are initiating or controlling the behavior of the hand and often express dismay at the hand's ""extravolitional"" activity.
 The patients attempt to control behavior of the alien hand with the unimpaired hand by forcibly restraining the affected limb, an act that may be termed ""self-restriction."" In this paper, we report an additional four cases of alien hand sign in right-handed subjects: two involving the right hand and two involving the left hand.
 In each case, the clinical findings were associated with extensive unilateral damage of the medial frontal cortex of the hemisphere contralateral to the affected hand.
 Furthermore, the alien movement gradually disappears over the course of 6-12 months after the stroke.
 These clinical case studies are presented and discussed in the context of the ""dual premotoer systems hypothesis,"" an anatomicophysiological model that proposes that action is organized by two separate but interactive premotor brain systems corresponding to evolutionarily defined medial and lateral cortical moieties.
 It is hypothesized that the alien mode behavior results from unconstrained activity of the lateral premotor system in the damaged hemisphere.
 The residual volitional control in the limb occurs through the activity of the intact medial premotor system of the ipsilateral hemisphere.
 Recovery may occur through extension of these ipsilateral control mechanisms by compensatory changes in subcortical systems controlling hemispheric activation associated with adaptive behavior.
 This observation may be important in understanding mechanisms involved in motor recovery after stroke.

 We randomly allocated patients having total hip replacements, carotid endarterectomies, or transsphenoidal hypophysectomies (total n = 270) to an anesthetic regimen with and without N2O (stratified within surgical group).
 A heat-and-moisture exchanger was included in the anesthetic circuit of all patients.
 Patients were monitored perioperatively and for 1 wk after surgery using intermittent and continuous pulse oximetry to determine oxyhemoglobin saturation.
 Intraoperatively, mean oxygen (O2) saturations were lower in patients given N2O, particularly older patients.
 Hypoxemia (O2 saturation less than 86%) developed in five patients receiving N2O and in one receiving O2.
 This difference was not significant.
 Administration of N2O did not decrease postoperative O2 saturation, nor did it alter the incidence of postoperative hypoxemia, cough, or sputum production.

 Outcomes of renal transplantation were reviewed for 26 transplants performed in 25 patients 60 years of age or older between 1985 and 1989.
 Three grafts were from family donors and 23 were from cadaver donors.
 Twenty-one were first transplants and five were retransplants.
 Cyclosporine was used as primary immunosuppression and azathioprine and prednisone were administered to most patients.
 Overall patient and graft actuarial survival rates were 79% and 71%, respectively, at both 1 and 3 years.
 Patients (n = 14) free of both diabetes and cardiac disease (low risk) had 1- and 3-year patient and graft survival rates of 91% and 84%, respectively.
 Conversely, high-risk patients (n = 12) had patient and graft survival rates at 1 and 3 years of 67% and 58%, respectively.
 Early deaths (less than or equal to 6 months) were caused by sepsis (two patients) or cardiac events (three patients), and four of the five were in high-risk patients.
 Irreversible rejections and serious infectious complications were not as common as steroid-induced diabetes, which occurred in five patients.
 This experience suggests that kidney transplantation can be done safely and successfully in patients older than 60 years of age and should be the treatment of choice for low-risk patients in this category.

 In this study, 50 consecutive patients over age 60 with obstructive jaundice secondary to malignant stricture of the distal common bile duct were identified by endoscopic cholangiography.
 The patients were then randomized to palliative therapy with either endoscopic endoprosthesis or bypass surgery.
 Prospective indices of survival time, complication rates, hospitalization requirements, and quality of life were followed.
 All 25 patients randomized to endoprosthesis were treated by this procedure, whereas only 19 of 25 patients randomized to bypass surgery underwent operative biliary-digestive anastomosis.

 The anatomical relationships between the renal venous arrangement and the pelviocaliceal system were studied in 52, 3-dimensional polyester resin corrosion endocasts.
 In 53.8% of the cases, there were 3 large venous trunks and in 28.8% there were 2 venous trunks joining to form the main renal vein.
 Intrarenal veins demonstrated free anastomoses that were disposed in 3 systems of longitudinal arcades (stellate, arcuate and interlobar veins).
 There were large venous collars around caliceal necks and also horizontal arches crossing over calices to link anterior and posterior veins.
 In 84.6% of the cases the upper caliceal group was encircled anteriorly and posteriorly by venous plexuses, which coursed parallel to the infundibulum.
 In 50.0% of the cases the lower caliceal group also was enriched by 2 venous plexuses.
 A close relationship existed between a large inferior tributary of the renal vein and the anterior aspect of the ureteropelvic junction in 40.4% of the cases.
 In 69.2% of the cases there was a posterior (retropelvic) vein: in 48.1% this vein had a close relationship to the junction of the pelvis with the upper calix and in 21.1% it crossed the middle posterior surface of the renal pelvis.

3145,"Acute hypervolaemic haemodilution to avoid blood transfusion during major surgery 
 16 patients underwent acute hypervolaemic haemodilution with dextran 40 and Ringers lactate, to see whether this procedure could avoid preoperative blood transfusion.
 Packed cell volume (PCV) and oxygen extraction decreased, and cardiac index and pulmonary wedge pressure increased, although end-systolic area was unchanged.
 PCV was not significantly different between patients who lost less than or greater than 20% of their initial blood volume.
 This preoperative manoeuvre, which reduces loss of red blood cells, allowed major surgery to be completed safely without blood transfusion.

3080,"Radionuclide imaging of asymptomatic versus symptomatic total knee arthroplasties.
 Ninety-eight total knee prostheses were evaluated by roentgenograms and bone scans.
 Fifty-three were asymptomatic, and 45 were symptomatic.
 Thirteen prostheses required revision surgery.
 At a mean of 54 months, asymptomatic knee replacements generally showed only mild uptake in one or more zones.
 Only one knee had uptake equal to surrounding bone.
 However, symptomatic knee replacements showed significantly greater uptake in the patella, femur, and medial and lateral tibial plateau regions (Mann-Whitney two-sample rank test).
 Bone scans in the symptomatic group were obtained at a mean of 44 months.
 Excluding those patients who had revision surgery, the differences remained significant.
 Furthermore, symptomatic knee replacements with normal roentgenograms also had significantly greater uptake.
 Radiolucent lines were noted in 30% of asymptomatic patients, whereas 29% of symptomatic knees had radiolucencies.
 Radiolucencies were not generally associated with significantly greater uptake.
 Lateral release had no effect on the patellar score.

3121,"Comparison of ventricular arrhythmia induction with use of an indwelling electrode catheter and a newly inserted catheter.
 Two methods of serial electrophysiologic testing are in widespread use.
 Most commonly, the electrode catheter is removed after each study and a new catheter reinserted through the femoral vein for every subsequent test.
 An alternative method employs an electrode catheter that remains in place during several days of serial testing.
 Little is known about differences between these two methods with respect to the likelihood of induction of arrhythmia or the frequency of complications.
 To determine whether inducibility of sustained arrhythmia is altered or if the frequency of complications is unacceptably high with use of an indwelling catheter, a prospective randomized study was conducted in 78 patients.
 Each patient underwent baseline testing, several days of electropharmacologic testing with an indwelling catheter, a 24 h drug elimination period and placement of a new electrode catheter.
 Ventricular stimulation studies were then performed in each patient with both the indwelling and new electrode catheters.
 No differences were found between the indwelling and new catheter tests with respect to induction of arrhythmia, number of extrastimuli required to induce arrhythmia, rate of arrhythmia or requirement for cardioversion.
 Ventricular pacing thresholds were higher and effective refractory periods were slightly longer when measured with the indwelling catheter.
 Complications related to the 156 catheter insertions included two that may have been related to the indwelling catheter (one episode of staphylococcal sepsis and one presumed pulmonary embolism) and four that were related to invasive procedures (pneumothorax in all).
 There were no long-term adverse sequelae of these complications.

3032,"Isoenzymes of aldehyde dehydrogenase in human lymphocytes.
 The types of isozymes of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) present in human lymphocytes has been investigated using isoelectric focusing of polyacrylamide gels followed by substrate-specific staining.
 Lymphocytes obtained from most individuals were found to contain both types I and II ALDH.
 This group of 'typical' individuals reported that they did not develop marked facial flushing or rapid heart rate after drinking alcohol nor did they develop an erythema to cutaneously applied ethanol.
 Lymphocytes obtained from 'atypical' individuals who do suffer from alcohol-induced flushing and rapid heart rate and who developed erythema to cutaneous ethanol displayed type II, but not type I, ALDH.
 Lymphocytes thus appear to be an easily accessible and suitable tissue for determining type I ALDH phenotype.

3040,"Meropenem pharmacokinetics and penetration into an inflammatory exudate.
 The pharmacokinetics and penetration into a cantharidine-induced inflammatory exudate of meropenem was studied in six volunteers following a single 1-g intravenous dose.
 Concentrations in plasma, urine, and the inflammatory exudate were determined by a microbiological assay.
 The mean elimination half-life of meropenem in plasma was 1.1 h, with the concentration in plasma declining from a mean of 23.6 micrograms/ml at 1 h to 0.7 micrograms/ml at 6 h.
 The inflammatory fluid penetration was rapid (time to maximum concentration of drug in serum, 0.75 h), and the penetration was 111%.
 The recovery of meropenem in urine at 24 h was 65.4% of the administered dose.

3085,"Review of the all-polyethylene tibial component in total knee arthroplasty. A minimum seven-year follow-up period.
 A retrospective analysis of 144 total knee arthroplasties was performed between 1975 and 1981 with a minimum follow-up period of seven years.
 A posterior cruciate condylar prosthesis was used in each procedure.
 Patients were followed clinically and roentgenographically, and a set of statistical variables was established based on elevation in joint line, tibial component angular alignment, overall limb alignment, and position of the tibial component on anteroposterior and lateral roentgenograms.
 Review of the study group found that the Hospital for Special Surgery knee scores improved from a preoperative score of 55 to a postoperative score of 88, with 94.5% having good or excellent results.
 The mean postoperative range of motion was 106 degrees with a mean extension of -0.3 degrees.
 Radiolucencies developed in 41% of the knees with 5% of the knees having progressive radiolucencies.
 Eight knees were considered failures based on clinical and roentgenographic evaluations.
 Factors found to significantly affect the formation of radiolucent lines included a shift of the tibial component medially by greater than 4 mm, a varus tilt of the tibial component greater than 2 degrees, and the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.
 The only variable associated with aseptic loosening was an elevation of the joint line by greater than 8 mm.

3036,"A comparison of parallel versus perpendicular placement of retention sutures in abdominal wound closure.
 A new technique for placement of retention sutures is described.
 Twenty-five rats underwent midline laparotomy incision.
 The control group was closed with traditional placement of through-and-through retention sutures placed in a perpendicular direction to the wound.
 The experimental group was closed with retention sutures placed in a parallel direction to the wound as described below.
 Wound bursting strength was significantly (P less than 0.001) greater at one to five days in the experimental group compared with the control animals.
 In addition, inflammatory reaction and pressure necrosis were greater in the control group.
 It appears that parallel placement of sutures has less of a tendency to cut through tissue when subjected to the distracting forces on a midline wound.

3299,"Functional and metabolic effects of bupivacaine and lignocaine in the rat heart-lung preparation.
 We have examined the effects of bupivacaine and lignocaine on myocardial metabolism in the rat isolated heart-lung preparation.
 Bupivacaine 1, 5 or 25 micrograms ml-1 or lignocaine 4, 20 or 100 micrograms ml-1 was administered 5 min after the start of perfusion.
 Both bupivacaine 25 micrograms ml-1 and lignocaine 100 micrograms ml-1 reduced heart rate significantly.
 Bupivacaine 25 micrograms ml-1 was associated with a higher incidence of arrhythmias than the other groups.
 Three hearts in the bupivacaine 25 micrograms ml-1 group (n = 8) and two hearts in the lignocaine 100 micrograms ml-1 group (n = 8) failed (zero cardiac output) at the end of the experiment.
 Although there were no significant differences in myocardial lactate and glycogen concentrations between groups, ATP content in the bupivacaine 25 micrograms ml-1 and lignocaine 100 micrograms ml-1 groups was significantly less than that in the control group.
 The results suggest that myocardial depression and subsequent metabolic deterioration occurred with both the high doses of local anaesthetics; these findings do not account for the apparent increased cardiotoxicity of bupivacaine.

3051,"Systemic pattern of free radical generation during coronary bypass surgery.
 Diffuse impairment of ventricular function after cardiac surgery may be related to the generation during reperfusion of the myocardium of free radicals derived from oxygen.
 Fifteen patients undergoing elective coronary bypass surgery were studied by previously described assays for peroxidised lipids and for isomerised lipids which were used as indices of free radical activity.
 Serial blood samples were obtained from systemic arterial, mixed venous, and coronary sinus catheters before, during, and after the ischaemic period.
 The patients underwent coronary artery surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass with a membrane oxygenator, relative hypothermia 30-34 degrees C, and intermittent cross-clamping of the aorta.
 During the ischaemic periods there were no significant changes in the indices of free radical activity.
 During the reperfusion phase there was a significant increase in free radical indices in arterial and mixed venous blood.
 A small rise in free radical indices in coronary venous blood was not statistically significant.
 These data indicate that free radical activity is increased in patients shortly after the cessation of cardiopulmonary bypass.
 The pattern of distribution between the different sampling sites suggests that much of the observed increase in isomerised and peroxidised lipids originates from tissues other than the myocardium.

3134,"Spontaneous regression of giant arteriovenous fistulae during the perinatal period. Case report.
 A unique case of spontaneous regression of giant arteriovenous fistulae during infancy is described in this report.
 A female infant, the product of normal labor and delivery, demonstrated severe ventriculomegaly and an intracranial hemorrhage at birth.
 Cerebral angiography at 5 days of age revealed several large fistulae fed by the anterior and middle cerebral arteries draining into the deep venous system through a dilated internal cerebral vein and ectatic vein of Galen.
 Two days following the angiogram, a second intracranial hemorrhage occurred.
 Active hydrocephalus developed over the next 6 months and was treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting.
 When the child was 8 months of age, angiography failed to demonstrate the fistulae.
 It was postulated that pressure effects from the intracranial hematoma and long-standing intracranial hypertension as well as stenosis in the anomalous venous outflow resulted in vascular stasis, venous thrombosis, and selective arterial occlusion.
 Hydrocephalus was a result of the compression of the intraventricular foramina by dilated embryonic vessels.
 This anomaly, predominantly involving the anterior circulation, may be homologous to the vein of Galen aneurysm in the posterior circulation.

3266,"The case for porous-coated hip implants. The femoral side.
 A series of 1163 total hip arthroplasties (THAs) using porous-coated femoral components were roentgenographically assessed for implant fixation.
 For 959 primary THAs followed from two to 12 years, the femoral revision rate was 1% and the ten-year survivorship rate was 96.4%; 150 young patients had a fixation failure incidence of only 1.3% at a mean follow-up period of 6.4 years; in 204 revision THAs, the femoral re-revision rate was 4% at a mean follow-up period of 53.4 months.
 Failures were largely related to inadequate femoral canal filling.
 Because of refinements in implant design and surgical techniques, a press fit of the implant is currently achieved in 94% of cases compared to 36% during the first five years.
 Porous-coated femoral components have yielded results equivalent to those with cement in primary THAs.
 Excellent results were observed in relatively young patients and patients with revisions.

3189,"Usefulness of combined propranolol and verapamil for evaluation of surgical ablation of accessory atrioventricular connections in patients without structural heart disease.
 Successful surgical ablation of atrioventricular (AV) accessory connections may be confirmed during postoperative electrophysiologic testing by the absence of accessory connection conduction in both the anterograde and retrograde directions.
 Whereas the former may be readily apparent by examination of the surface electrocardiogram during sinus rhythm or atrial pacing, assessment of the latter may be complicated by the frequent presence of enhanced retrograde AV nodal conduction in the postoperative period.
 Consequently, availability of interventions that selectively affect AV nodal conduction and refractoriness without concomitant effects on accessory connections may be helpful for assessing the success of the surgical procedure.
 In this study the effects of combined propranolol and verapamil administration on electrophysiologic properties of the AV node and the accessory AV connection were assessed both pre- and postoperatively in 17 patients (12 men and 5 women, mean age 33 years) undergoing surgical ablation of accessory connections.
 Preoperatively, electrophysiologic characteristics of all but 1 of the accessory AV connections were unaffected by propranolol and verapamil administration.
 Postoperatively, on the other hand, propranolol and verapamil significantly prolonged both the retrograde AV node effective refractory period (baseline: 272 +/- 34 ms vs after drugs: 384 +/- 70 ms [p less than 0.0001]) and the shortest cycle length maintaining 1:1 ventriculoatrial conduction (baseline: 357 +/- 99 ms vs after drugs: 485 +/- 64 ms [p less than 0.0001]).
 Late postoperative electrophysiologic evaluation (7 +/- 3 weeks) revealed no evidence of residual accessory AV connection conduction, and all patients remain asymptomatic at 21 +/- 10 months follow-up.

3245,"The use of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to determine lesion site in traumatic facial paralysis.
 Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging has been used to evaluate 20 patients with surgically confirmed facial nerve lesions.
 When the nerve could be seen, gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging accurately revealed the lesion site as well as the known extent, which in some cases was not predicted by topognostic testing.
 This technique appears to provide accurate lesion-site testing and may have importance in surgical planning.
 Currently used topognostic tests of facial nerve function are frequently inaccurate and can only determine the most proximal lesion site when there are multiple or extensive lesions.
 The focal nerve enhancement seen in nerve injury, globally increased signal intensity within the temporal bone after trauma, and increased signal intensity within the dura after surgery can occasionally mask nerve lesions and may be confused with tumors.

3108,"Maximal O2 uptake of in situ dog muscle during acute hypoxemia with constant perfusion.
 We investigated the relationships among maximal O2 uptake (VO2max), effluent venous PO2 (PvO2), and calculated mean capillary PO2 (PCO2) in isolated dog gastrocnemius in situ as arterial PO2 (PaO2) was progressively reduced with muscle blood flow held constant.
 The hypothesis that VO2max is determined in part by peripheral tissue O2 diffusion predicts proportional declines in VO2max and PCO2 if the diffusing capacity of the muscle remains constant.
 The inspired O2 fraction was altered in each of six dogs to produce four different levels of PaO2 [22 +/- 2, 29 +/- 1, 38 +/- 1, and 79 +/- 4 (SE) Torr].
 Muscle blood flow, with the circulation isolated, was held constant at 122 +/- 15 ml.100 g-1.min-1 while the muscle worked maximally (isometric twitches at 5-7 Hz) at each of the four different values of PaO2.
 Arterial and venous samples were taken to measure lactate, pH, PO2, PCO2, and muscle VO2.
 PCO2 was calculated using Fick's law of diffusion and a Bohr integration procedure.
 VO2max fell progressively (P less than 0.01) with decreasing PaO2.
 The decline in VO2max was proportional (R = 0.99) to the fall in both muscle PvO2 and calculated PCO2 while the calculated muscle diffusing capacity was not different among the four conditions.
 Fatigue developed more rapidly with lower PaO2, although lactate output from the muscle was not different among conditions.
 These results are consistent with the hypothesis that resistance to O2 diffusion in the peripheral tissue may be a principal determinant of VO2max.

 Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has become the preferred method of enteral access for nutritional support.
 With increased use of this modality, complications are encountered more frequently.
 Premature withdrawal, inadvertent removal of the gastrostomy tube within the first seven days after insertion, before adherence of the gastric serosa to the parietal peritoneum, has been an indication for laparotomy.
 This report describes the treatment of premature withdrawal by immediate endoscopic replacement.
 Over an 18-month period, 271 patients underwent insertion of a PEG.
 Five patients (1.8%) who inadvertently removed their gastrostomy tube within seven days of insertion were treated with immediate replacement using the retrograde string technique, avoiding laparotomy.
 All five PEGs were successfully replaced through the same gastrostomy site.
 Despite the presence of pneumoperitoneum, no patient developed peritonitis or other septic complications.
 Premature gastrostomy tube withdrawal is safely managed by endoscopic replacement and observation.
 Laparotomy is unnecessary and potentially meddlesome.

 Laboratory test results are a valuable source of information.
 Nurses need to assess laboratory test results as part of the physical assessment of their patients.
 Comparison of laboratory test results and changes with abnormal physical findings provides the basis for changes in the nursing care plan.
 Progressive monitoring of laboratory results and prompt interventions might lessen the seriousness of the health problem.
 In acute care units, the initial group of laboratory tests serves as a baseline for assessing additional test results.
 Several reference values should be remembered, particularly the electrolytes (potassium, sodium, and calcium), glucose, BUN, creatinine, and albumin.
 Specific group profiles assist in identifying and in monitoring the patient's health status.
 Incorporating laboratory test results into the plan and evaluation of care will result in safer and more effective patient care.
 Referring to laboratory test findings and comparing them with physical assessment findings are required for the delivery of professional nursing care.

3096,"Morphological and biochemical changes in gastric mucosa of aging rats.
 Although previous data from this laboratory have indicated that aging is associated with increased gastric mucosal proliferative activity, no direct assessment of proliferative potential of the tissue has been made during aging.
 In order to assess this, and to determine whether changes in mucosal proliferative potential would be reflected in growth of the tissue, we have examined the labeling index (LI), height and morphology of the gastric mucosa in young (4-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) Fischer-344 rats.
 In addition, tyrosine kinase (Tyr-k) activity and the levels of phosphotyrosine proteins were determined to evaluate their relationship to mucosal proliferative activity.
 Histologic evaluation revealed a marked atrophy of the mucosal glandular component with 32% reduction in height in aged rats when compared with young animals.
 In aged rats, there was also a decrease in gland density, resulting in a reduction in the number of epithelial cells of all types with evidence of decreased secretory activity.
 Despite the occurrence of mucosal atrophy in aged rats, LI in these animals was significantly increased by 28%.
 This was associated with a parallel rise in mucosal Tyr-k activity, and a two- to threefold increase in the relative concentrations of seven phosphotyrosine membrane proteins with Mr of 120, 105, 90, 60, 55, 48 and 32 kDa.
 We conclude that (1) although aging is associated with increased gastric mucosal proliferative activity, this does not result in mucosal growth and that (2) Tyr-k and tyrosine phosphorylation of certain proteins play a role in the regulation of gastric mucosal cell proliferation during aging.

 Synthesis of normal human hemoglobin A, alpha 2 beta 2, is based upon balanced expression of genes in the alpha-globin gene cluster on chromosome 16 and the beta-globin gene cluster on chromosome 11.
 Full levels of erythroid-specific activation of the beta-globin cluster depend on sequences located at a considerable distance 5' to the beta-globin gene, referred to as the locus-activating or dominant control region.
 The existence of an analogous element(s) upstream of the alpha-globin cluster has been suggested from observations on naturally occurring deletions and experimental studies.
 We have identified an individual with alpha-thalassemia in whom structurally normal alpha-globin genes have been inactivated in cis by a discrete de novo 35-kilobase deletion located approximately 30 kilobases 5' from the alpha-globin gene cluster.
 We conclude that this deletion inactivates expression of the alpha-globin genes by removing one or more of the previously identified upstream regulatory sequences that are critical to expression of the alpha-globin genes.

3084,"The effect of continuous epidural analgesia on postoperative pain, rehabilitation, and duration of hospitalization in total knee arthroplasty.
 Efficacies of three alternate methods of postoperative analgesia were studied in 156 patients who had total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
 Forty-two of these patients received parenteral meperidine hydrochloride or morphine (Group 1), 58 patients received periodic epidural injections of morphine (Group 2), and 56 patients received continuous epidural infusions of bupivacaine hydrochloride and Duramorph (Group 3).
 The postoperative course of all patients was documented in terms of the incidence and severity of pain, range of joint motion, duration of hospitalization, and occurrence of complications.
 Although epidural analgesia increased the cost and duration of the operation, good-to-excellent pain relief was attained in 86% (Group 2) and 88% (Group 3) of cases with epidural analgesia compared with 61% of patients (Group 1) receiving conventional analgesia.
 Moreover, 67% of patients in Group 1 experienced frequent episodes of moderate-to-severe postoperative pain in contrast to 40% of patients in Group 2 and only 10% of patients in Group 3.
 As a result of diminished pain, greater joint motion was obtained within the first 72 hours in Groups 2 and 3.
 They also had shorter hospitalization (9.6 days versus 11.2 days for Group 1 and 10.8 days for Group 2).
 However, the use of epidural analgesia did not reduce the incidence of complications, including nausea.
 Continuous infusion of epidural bupivacaine and Duramorph provided good-to-excellent control of postoperative pain after TKA.
 However, better analgesics are needed to reduce the high incidence of side effects associated with various treatment methods.

 The purpose of this study was to compare the reproducibility of two approaches to the evaluation of GH secretion: the integrated concentration of GH (IC-GH), a physiological test of GH secretion, and pharmacological stimulation tests.
 IC-GH was determined in 40 poorly growing children twice within 4 weeks.
 The first and second IC-GH were highly correlated r = 0.859, P less than 0.001.
 One hundred and thirteen poorly growing children underwent pharmacological GH stimulation tests twice within 6 weeks.
 A moderate correlation was found between the first and second pharmacological test r = 0.524, P less than 0.01.
 Among the three pharmacological stimuli studied, clonidine (n = 81) had the highest reproducibility followed by arginine (n = 20), and insulin (n = 12).
 We conclude that IC-GH is more consistently reproducible than the GH response to repeated pharmacological stimulation.
